# Administration

Kafka Connect's REST layer provides a set of APIs to enable administration of the cluster. This includes APIs to view the configuration of connectors and the status of their tasks, as well as to alter their current behavior (e.g. changing configuration and restarting tasks). 

When a connector is first submitted to the cluster, a rebalance is triggered between the Connect workers in order to distribute the load that consists of the tasks of the new connector. This same rebalancing procedure is also used when connectors increase or decrease the number of tasks they require, when a connector's configuration is changed, or when a worker is added or removed from the group as part of an intentional upgrade of the Connect cluster or due to a failure. 

In versions prior to 2.3.0, the Connect workers would rebalance the full set of connectors and their tasks in the cluster as a simple way to make sure that each worker has approximately the same amount of work. This behavior can be still enabled by setting `connect.protocol=eager`. 

Starting with 2.3.0, Kafka Connect is using by default a protocol that performs [incremental cooperative rebalancing](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-415%3A+Incremental+Cooperative+Rebalancing+in+Kafka+Connect) that incrementally balances the connectors and tasks across the Connect workers, affecting only tasks that are new, to be removed, or need to move from one worker to another. Other tasks are not stopped and restarted during the rebalance, as they would have been with the old protocol. 

If a Connect worker leaves the group, intentionally or due to a failure, Connect waits for `scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms` before triggering a rebalance. This delay defaults to five minutes (`300000ms`) to tolerate failures or upgrades of workers without immediately redistributing the load of a departing worker. If this worker returns within the configured delay, it gets its previously assigned tasks in full. However, this means that the tasks will remain unassigned until the time specified by `scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms` elapses. If a worker does not return within that time limit, Connect will reassign those tasks among the remaining workers in the Connect cluster. 

The new Connect protocol is enabled when all the workers that form the Connect cluster are configured with `connect.protocol=compatible`, which is also the default value when this property is missing. Therefore, upgrading to the new Connect protocol happens automatically when all the workers upgrade to 2.3.0. A rolling upgrade of the Connect cluster will activate incremental cooperative rebalancing when the last worker joins on version 2.3.0. 

You can use the REST API to view the current status of a connector and its tasks, including the ID of the worker to which each was assigned. For example, the `GET /connectors/file-source/status` request shows the status of a connector named `file-source`: 
    
    
    {
        "name": "file-source",
        "connector": {
            "state": "RUNNING",
            "worker_id": "192.168.1.208:8083"
        },
        "tasks": [
            {
                "id": 0,
                "state": "RUNNING",
                "worker_id": "192.168.1.209:8083"
            }
        ]
    }

Connectors and their tasks publish status updates to a shared topic (configured with `status.storage.topic`) which all workers in the cluster monitor. Because the workers consume this topic asynchronously, there is typically a (short) delay before a state change is visible through the status API. The following states are possible for a connector or one of its tasks: 

  * **UNASSIGNED:** The connector/task has not yet been assigned to a worker.
  * **RUNNING:** The connector/task is running.
  * **PAUSED:** The connector/task has been administratively paused.
  * **STOPPED:** The connector has been stopped. Note that this state is not applicable to tasks because the tasks for a stopped connector are shut down and won't be visible in the status API.
  * **FAILED:** The connector/task has failed (usually by raising an exception, which is reported in the status output).
  * **RESTARTING:** The connector/task is either actively restarting or is expected to restart soon



In most cases, connector and task states will match, though they may be different for short periods of time when changes are occurring or if tasks have failed. For example, when a connector is first started, there may be a noticeable delay before the connector and its tasks have all transitioned to the RUNNING state. States will also diverge when tasks fail since Connect does not automatically restart failed tasks. To restart a connector/task manually, you can use the restart APIs listed above. Note that if you try to restart a task while a rebalance is taking place, Connect will return a 409 (Conflict) status code. You can retry after the rebalance completes, but it might not be necessary since rebalances effectively restart all the connectors and tasks in the cluster. 

Starting with 2.5.0, Kafka Connect uses the `status.storage.topic` to also store information related to the topics that each connector is using. Connect Workers use these per-connector topic status updates to respond to requests to the REST endpoint `GET /connectors/{name}/topics` by returning the set of topic names that a connector is using. A request to the REST endpoint `PUT /connectors/{name}/topics/reset` resets the set of active topics for a connector and allows a new set to be populated, based on the connector's latest pattern of topic usage. Upon connector deletion, the set of the connector's active topics is also deleted. Topic tracking is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting `topic.tracking.enable=false`. If you want to disallow requests to reset the active topics of connectors during runtime, set the Worker property `topic.tracking.allow.reset=false`. 

It's sometimes useful to temporarily stop the message processing of a connector. For example, if the remote system is undergoing maintenance, it would be preferable for source connectors to stop polling it for new data instead of filling logs with exception spam. For this use case, Connect offers a pause/resume API. While a source connector is paused, Connect will stop polling it for additional records. While a sink connector is paused, Connect will stop pushing new messages to it. The pause state is persistent, so even if you restart the cluster, the connector will not begin message processing again until the task has been resumed. Note that there may be a delay before all of a connector's tasks have transitioned to the PAUSED state since it may take time for them to finish whatever processing they were in the middle of when being paused. Additionally, failed tasks will not transition to the PAUSED state until they have been restarted. 

In 3.5.0, Connect introduced a stop API that completely shuts down the tasks for a connector and deallocates any resources claimed by them. This is different from pausing a connector where tasks are left idling and any resources claimed by them are left allocated (which allows the connector to begin processing data quickly once it is resumed). Stopping a connector is more efficient from a resource usage standpoint than pausing it, but can cause it to take longer to begin processing data once resumed. Note that the offsets for a connector can be only modified via the offsets management endpoints if it is in the stopped state.
