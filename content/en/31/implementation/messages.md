# Messages

Messages consist of a variable-length header, a variable-length opaque key byte array and a variable-length opaque value byte array. The format of the header is described in the following section. Leaving the key and value opaque is the right decision: there is a great deal of progress being made on serialization libraries right now, and any particular choice is unlikely to be right for all uses. Needless to say a particular application using Kafka would likely mandate a particular serialization type as part of its usage. The `RecordBatch` interface is simply an iterator over messages with specialized methods for bulk reading and writing to an NIO `Channel`.
