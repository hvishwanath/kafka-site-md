# ZooKeeper Encryption 

ZooKeeper connections that use mutual TLS are encrypted. Beginning with ZooKeeper version 3.5.7 (the version shipped with Kafka version 2.5) ZooKeeper supports a sever-side config `ssl.clientAuth` (case-insensitively: `want`/`need`/`none` are the valid options, the default is `need`), and setting this value to `none` in ZooKeeper allows clients to connect via a TLS-encrypted connection without presenting their own certificate. Here is a sample (partial) Kafka Broker configuration for connecting to ZooKeeper with just TLS encryption. These configurations are described above in Broker Configs. 
    
    
            # connect to the ZooKeeper port configured for TLS
            zookeeper.connect=zk1:2182,zk2:2182,zk3:2182
            # required to use TLS to ZooKeeper (default is false)
            zookeeper.ssl.client.enable=true
            # required to use TLS to ZooKeeper
            zookeeper.clientCnxnSocket=org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNetty
            # define trust stores to use TLS to ZooKeeper; ignored unless zookeeper.ssl.client.enable=true
            # no need to set keystore information assuming ssl.clientAuth=none on ZooKeeper
            zookeeper.ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/kafka/truststore.jks
            zookeeper.ssl.truststore.password=kafka-ts-passwd
            # tell broker to create ACLs on znodes (if using SASL authentication, otherwise do not set this)
            zookeeper.set.acl=true
