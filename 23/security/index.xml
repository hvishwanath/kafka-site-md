The following security measures are currently supported:
Authentication of connections to brokers from clients (producers and consumers), other brokers and tools, using either SSL or SASL. Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms: SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0 SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0 SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.</description></item><item><title>Encryption and Authentication using SSL</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/encryption-and-authentication-using-ssl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/encryption-and-authentication-using-ssl/</guid><description>Encryption and Authentication using SSL Apache Kafka allows clients to connect over SSL. By default, SSL is disabled but can be turned on as needed.
Generate SSL key and certificate for each Kafka broker The first step of deploying one or more brokers with the SSL support is to generate the key and the certificate for each machine in the cluster. You can use Java&amp;rsquo;s keytool utility to accomplish this task.</description></item><item><title>Authentication using SASL</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/authentication-using-sasl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/authentication-using-sasl/</guid><description>Authentication using SASL JAAS configuration Kafka uses the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) for SASL configuration.
1. ##### JAAS configuration for Kafka brokers KafkaServer is the section name in the JAAS file used by each KafkaServer/Broker. This section provides SASL configuration options for the broker including any SASL client connections made by the broker for inter-broker communication. If multiple listeners are configured to use SASL, the section name may be prefixed with the listener name in lower-case followed by a period, e.</description></item><item><title>Authorization and ACLs</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/authorization-and-acls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/authorization-and-acls/</guid><description>Authorization and ACLs Kafka ships with a pluggable Authorizer and an out-of-box authorizer implementation that uses zookeeper to store all the acls. The Authorizer is configured by setting authorizer.class.name in server.properties. To enable the out of the box implementation use:
authorizer.class.name=kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer Kafka acls are defined in the general format of &amp;ldquo;Principal P is [Allowed/Denied] Operation O From Host H on any Resource R matching ResourcePattern RP&amp;rdquo;. You can read more about the acl structure in KIP-11 and resource patterns in KIP-290.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Security Features in a Running Cluster</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/incorporating-security-features-in-a-running-cluster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/incorporating-security-features-in-a-running-cluster/</guid><description>Incorporating Security Features in a Running Cluster You can secure a running cluster via one or more of the supported protocols discussed previously. This is done in phases:
Incrementally bounce the cluster nodes to open additional secured port(s). Restart clients using the secured rather than PLAINTEXT port (assuming you are securing the client-broker connection). Incrementally bounce the cluster again to enable broker-to-broker security (if this is required) A final incremental bounce to close the PLAINTEXT port.</description></item><item><title>ZooKeeper Authentication</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/zookeeper-authentication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/23/security/zookeeper-authentication/</guid><description>ZooKeeper Authentication New clusters To enable ZooKeeper authentication on brokers, there are two necessary steps:
Create a JAAS login file and set the appropriate system property to point to it as described above Set the configuration property zookeeper.set.acl in each broker to true The metadata stored in ZooKeeper for the Kafka cluster is world-readable, but can only be modified by the brokers. The rationale behind this decision is that the data stored in ZooKeeper is not sensitive, but inappropriate manipulation of that data can cause cluster disruption.</description></item></channel></rss>
