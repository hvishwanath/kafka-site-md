What exactly does that mean?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#apache-kafka-is-_a-distributed-streaming-platform_-what-exactly-does-that-mean aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>A streaming platform has three key capabilities:</p><ul><li>Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.</li><li>Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.</li><li>Process streams of records as they occur.</li></ul><p>Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:</p><ul><li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications</li><li>Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data</li></ul><p>To understand how Kafka does these things, let&rsquo;s dive in and explore Kafka&rsquo;s capabilities from the bottom up.</p><p>First a few concepts:</p><ul><li>Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers that can span multiple datacenters.</li><li>The Kafka cluster stores streams of <em>records</em> in categories called <em>topics</em>.</li><li>Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.</li></ul><p>Kafka has four core APIs:</p><ul><li>The <a href=/documentation.html#producerapi>Producer API</a> allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics.</li><li>The <a href=/documentation.html#consumerapi>Consumer API</a> allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them.</li><li>The <a href=/streams>Streams API</a> allows an application to act as a <em>stream processor</em> , consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams.</li><li>The <a href=/documentation.html#connect>Connector API</a> allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table.
<img src=/0110/images/kafka-apis.png></li></ul><p>In Kafka the communication between the clients and the servers is done with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic <a href=/protocol.html>TCP protocol</a>. This protocol is versioned and maintains backwards compatibility with older version. We provide a Java client for Kafka, but clients are available in <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients>many languages</a>.</p><h2 id=topics-and-logs>Topics and Logs<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#topics-and-logs aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s first dive into the core abstraction Kafka provides for a stream of records&ndash;the topic.</p><p>A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it.</p><p>For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log that looks like this:</p><p><img src=/0110/images/log_anatomy.png></p><p>Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to&ndash;a structured commit log. The records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the <em>offset</em> that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.</p><p>The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records&ndash;whether or not they have been consumed&ndash;using a configurable retention period. For example, if the retention policy is set to two days, then for the two days after a record is published, it is available for consumption, after which it will be discarded to free up space. Kafka&rsquo;s performance is effectively constant with respect to data size so storing data for a long time is not a problem.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/log_consumer.png></p><p>In fact, the only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in the log. This offset is controlled by the consumer: normally a consumer will advance its offset linearly as it reads records, but, in fact, since the position is controlled by the consumer it can consume records in any order it likes. For example a consumer can reset to an older offset to reprocess data from the past or skip ahead to the most recent record and start consuming from &ldquo;now&rdquo;.</p><p>This combination of features means that Kafka consumers are very cheap&ndash;they can come and go without much impact on the cluster or on other consumers. For example, you can use our command line tools to &ldquo;tail&rdquo; the contents of any topic without changing what is consumed by any existing consumers.</p><p>The partitions in the log serve several purposes. First, they allow the log to scale beyond a size that will fit on a single server. Each individual partition must fit on the servers that host it, but a topic may have many partitions so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data. Second they act as the unit of parallelism&ndash;more on that in a bit.</p><h2 id=distribution>Distribution<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#distribution aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka cluster with each server handling data and requests for a share of the partitions. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.</p><p>Each partition has one server which acts as the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; and zero or more servers which act as &ldquo;followers&rdquo;. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition while the followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically become the new leader. Each server acts as a leader for some of its partitions and a follower for others so load is well balanced within the cluster.</p><h2 id=geo-replication>Geo-Replication<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#geo-replication aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka MirrorMaker provides geo-replication support for your clusters. With MirrorMaker, messages are replicated across multiple datacenters or cloud regions. You can use this in active/passive scenarios for backup and recovery; or in active/active scenarios to place data closer to your users, or support data locality requirements.</p><h2 id=producers>Producers<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#producers aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Producers publish data to the topics of their choice. The producer is responsible for choosing which record to assign to which partition within the topic. This can be done in a round-robin fashion simply to balance load or it can be done according to some semantic partition function (say based on some key in the record). More on the use of partitioning in a second!</p><h2 id=consumers>Consumers<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#consumers aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Consumers label themselves with a <em>consumer group</em> name, and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. Consumer instances can be in separate processes or on separate machines.</p><p>If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group, then the records will effectively be load balanced over the consumer instances.</p><p>If all the consumer instances have different consumer groups, then each record will be broadcast to all the consumer processes.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/consumer-groups.png></p><p>A two server Kafka cluster hosting four partitions (P0-P3) with two consumer groups. Consumer group A has two consumer instances and group B has four.</p><p>More commonly, however, we have found that topics have a small number of consumer groups, one for each &ldquo;logical subscriber&rdquo;. Each group is composed of many consumer instances for scalability and fault tolerance. This is nothing more than publish-subscribe semantics where the subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process.</p><p>The way consumption is implemented in Kafka is by dividing up the partitions in the log over the consumer instances so that each instance is the exclusive consumer of a &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; of partitions at any point in time. This process of maintaining membership in the group is handled by the Kafka protocol dynamically. If new instances join the group they will take over some partitions from other members of the group; if an instance dies, its partitions will be distributed to the remaining instances.</p><p>Kafka only provides a total order over records <em>within</em> a partition, not between different partitions in a topic. Per-partition ordering combined with the ability to partition data by key is sufficient for most applications. However, if you require a total order over records this can be achieved with a topic that has only one partition, though this will mean only one consumer process per consumer group.</p><h2 id=multi-tenancy>Multi-tenancy<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#multi-tenancy aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You can deploy Kafka as a multi-tenant solution. Multi-tenancy is enabled by configuring which topics can produce or consume data. There is also operations support for quotas. Administrators can define and enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources that are used by clients. For more information, see the <a href=/#security>security documentation</a>.</p><h2 id=guarantees>Guarantees<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#guarantees aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>At a high-level Kafka gives the following guarantees:</p><ul><li>Messages sent by a producer to a particular topic partition will be appended in the order they are sent. That is, if a record M1 is sent by the same producer as a record M2, and M1 is sent first, then M1 will have a lower offset than M2 and appear earlier in the log.</li><li>A consumer instance sees records in the order they are stored in the log.</li><li>For a topic with replication factor N, we will tolerate up to N-1 server failures without losing any records committed to the log.</li></ul><p>More details on these guarantees are given in the design section of the documentation.</p><h2 id=kafka-as-a-messaging-system>Kafka as a Messaging System<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-as-a-messaging-system aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>How does Kafka&rsquo;s notion of streams compare to a traditional enterprise messaging system?</p><p>Messaging traditionally has two models: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue>queuing</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern>publish-subscribe</a>. In a queue, a pool of consumers may read from a server and each record goes to one of them; in publish-subscribe the record is broadcast to all consumers. Each of these two models has a strength and a weakness. The strength of queuing is that it allows you to divide up the processing of data over multiple consumer instances, which lets you scale your processing. Unfortunately, queues aren&rsquo;t multi-subscriber&ndash;once one process reads the data it&rsquo;s gone. Publish-subscribe allows you broadcast data to multiple processes, but has no way of scaling processing since every message goes to every subscriber.</p><p>The consumer group concept in Kafka generalizes these two concepts. As with a queue the consumer group allows you to divide up processing over a collection of processes (the members of the consumer group). As with publish-subscribe, Kafka allows you to broadcast messages to multiple consumer groups.</p><p>The advantage of Kafka&rsquo;s model is that every topic has both these properties&ndash;it can scale processing and is also multi-subscriber&ndash;there is no need to choose one or the other.</p><p>Kafka has stronger ordering guarantees than a traditional messaging system, too.</p><p>A traditional queue retains records in-order on the server, and if multiple consumers consume from the queue then the server hands out records in the order they are stored. However, although the server hands out records in order, the records are delivered asynchronously to consumers, so they may arrive out of order on different consumers. This effectively means the ordering of the records is lost in the presence of parallel consumption. Messaging systems often work around this by having a notion of &ldquo;exclusive consumer&rdquo; that allows only one process to consume from a queue, but of course this means that there is no parallelism in processing.</p><p>Kafka does it better. By having a notion of parallelism&ndash;the partition&ndash;within the topics, Kafka is able to provide both ordering guarantees and load balancing over a pool of consumer processes. This is achieved by assigning the partitions in the topic to the consumers in the consumer group so that each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group. By doing this we ensure that the consumer is the only reader of that partition and consumes the data in order. Since there are many partitions this still balances the load over many consumer instances. Note however that there cannot be more consumer instances in a consumer group than partitions.</p><h2 id=kafka-as-a-storage-system>Kafka as a Storage System<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-as-a-storage-system aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Any message queue that allows publishing messages decoupled from consuming them is effectively acting as a storage system for the in-flight messages. What is different about Kafka is that it is a very good storage system.</p><p>Data written to Kafka is written to disk and replicated for fault-tolerance. Kafka allows producers to wait on acknowledgement so that a write isn&rsquo;t considered complete until it is fully replicated and guaranteed to persist even if the server written to fails.</p><p>The disk structures Kafka uses scale well&ndash;Kafka will perform the same whether you have 50 KB or 50 TB of persistent data on the server.</p><p>As a result of taking storage seriously and allowing the clients to control their read position, you can think of Kafka as a kind of special purpose distributed filesystem dedicated to high-performance, low-latency commit log storage, replication, and propagation.</p><p>For details about the Kafka&rsquo;s commit log storage and replication design, please read <a href=/#design>this</a> page.</p><h2 id=kafka-for-stream-processing>Kafka for Stream Processing<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-for-stream-processing aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>It isn&rsquo;t enough to just read, write, and store streams of data, the purpose is to enable real-time processing of streams.</p><p>In Kafka a stream processor is anything that takes continual streams of data from input topics, performs some processing on this input, and produces continual streams of data to output topics.</p><p>For example, a retail application might take in input streams of sales and shipments, and output a stream of reorders and price adjustments computed off this data.</p><p>It is possible to do simple processing directly using the producer and consumer APIs. However for more complex transformations Kafka provides a fully integrated <a href=/streams>Streams API</a>. This allows building applications that do non-trivial processing that compute aggregations off of streams or join streams together.</p><p>This facility helps solve the hard problems this type of application faces: handling out-of-order data, reprocessing input as code changes, performing stateful computations, etc.</p><p>The streams API builds on the core primitives Kafka provides: it uses the producer and consumer APIs for input, uses Kafka for stateful storage, and uses the same group mechanism for fault tolerance among the stream processor instances.</p><h2 id=putting-the-pieces-together>Putting the Pieces Together<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#putting-the-pieces-together aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>This combination of messaging, storage, and stream processing may seem unusual but it is essential to Kafka&rsquo;s role as a streaming platform.</p><p>A distributed file system like HDFS allows storing static files for batch processing. Effectively a system like this allows storing and processing <em>historical</em> data from the past.</p><p>A traditional enterprise messaging system allows processing future messages that will arrive after you subscribe. Applications built in this way process future data as it arrives.</p><p>Kafka combines both of these capabilities, and the combination is critical both for Kafka usage as a platform for streaming applications as well as for streaming data pipelines.</p><p>By combining storage and low-latency subscriptions, streaming applications can treat both past and future data the same way. That is a single application can process historical, stored data but rather than ending when it reaches the last record it can keep processing as future data arrives. This is a generalized notion of stream processing that subsumes batch processing as well as message-driven applications.</p><p>Likewise for streaming data pipelines the combination of subscription to real-time events make it possible to use Kafka for very low-latency pipelines; but the ability to store data reliably make it possible to use it for critical data where the delivery of data must be guaranteed or for integration with offline systems that load data only periodically or may go down for extended periods of time for maintenance. The stream processing facilities make it possible to transform data as it arrives.</p><p>For more information on the guarantees, apis, and capabilities Kafka provides see the rest of the <a href=/documentation.html>documentation</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-466fd93f299f21932fc98e6c19df7f4c>1.2 - Use Cases</h1><p>Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka™. For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see <a href=https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying/>this blog post</a>.</p><h2 id=messaging>Messaging<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#messaging aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc). In comparison to most messaging systems Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good solution for large scale message processing applications.</p><p>In our experience messaging uses are often comparatively low-throughput, but may require low end-to-end latency and often depend on the strong durability guarantees Kafka provides.</p><p>In this domain Kafka is comparable to traditional messaging systems such as <a href=http://activemq.apache.org>ActiveMQ</a> or <a href=https://www.rabbitmq.com>RabbitMQ</a>.</p><h2 id=website-activity-tracking>Website Activity Tracking<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#website-activity-tracking aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The original use case for Kafka was to be able to rebuild a user activity tracking pipeline as a set of real-time publish-subscribe feeds. This means site activity (page views, searches, or other actions users may take) is published to central topics with one topic per activity type. These feeds are available for subscription for a range of use cases including real-time processing, real-time monitoring, and loading into Hadoop or offline data warehousing systems for offline processing and reporting.</p><p>Activity tracking is often very high volume as many activity messages are generated for each user page view.</p><h2 id=metrics>Metrics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#metrics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data. This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.</p><h2 id=log-aggregation>Log Aggregation<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#log-aggregation aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Many people use Kafka as a replacement for a log aggregation solution. Log aggregation typically collects physical log files off servers and puts them in a central place (a file server or HDFS perhaps) for processing. Kafka abstracts away the details of files and gives a cleaner abstraction of log or event data as a stream of messages. This allows for lower-latency processing and easier support for multiple data sources and distributed data consumption. In comparison to log-centric systems like Scribe or Flume, Kafka offers equally good performance, stronger durability guarantees due to replication, and much lower end-to-end latency.</p><h2 id=stream-processing>Stream Processing<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#stream-processing aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Many users of Kafka process data in processing pipelines consisting of multiple stages, where raw input data is consumed from Kafka topics and then aggregated, enriched, or otherwise transformed into new topics for further consumption or follow-up processing. For example, a processing pipeline for recommending news articles might crawl article content from RSS feeds and publish it to an &ldquo;articles&rdquo; topic; further processing might normalize or deduplicate this content and publish the cleansed article content to a new topic; a final processing stage might attempt to recommend this content to users. Such processing pipelines create graphs of real-time data flows based on the individual topics. Starting in 0.10.0.0, a light-weight but powerful stream processing library called <a href=/streams>Kafka Streams</a> is available in Apache Kafka to perform such data processing as described above. Apart from Kafka Streams, alternative open source stream processing tools include <a href=https://storm.apache.org/>Apache Storm</a> and <a href=http://samza.apache.org/>Apache Samza</a>.</p><h2 id=event-sourcing>Event Sourcing<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#event-sourcing aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p><a href=http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html>Event sourcing</a> is a style of application design where state changes are logged as a time-ordered sequence of records. Kafka&rsquo;s support for very large stored log data makes it an excellent backend for an application built in this style.</p><h2 id=commit-log>Commit Log<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#commit-log aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka can serve as a kind of external commit-log for a distributed system. The log helps replicate data between nodes and acts as a re-syncing mechanism for failed nodes to restore their data. The <a href=/documentation.html#compaction>log compaction</a> feature in Kafka helps support this usage. In this usage Kafka is similar to <a href=http://zookeeper.apache.org/bookkeeper/>Apache BookKeeper</a> project.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-77451d296aa71fba15d304cc718c674a>1.3 - Quick Start</h1><p>This tutorial assumes you are starting fresh and have no existing Kafka or ZooKeeper data.

</code></pre><p>We can now see that topic if we run the list topic command:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
test
</code></pre><p>Alternatively, instead of manually creating topics you can also configure your brokers to auto-create topics when a non-existent topic is published to.</p><h2 id=step-4-send-some-messages>Step 4: Send some messages<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-4-send-some-messages aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka comes with a command line client that will take input from a file or from standard input and send it out as messages to the Kafka cluster. By default, each line will be sent as a separate message.</p><p>Run the producer and then type a few messages into the console to send to the server.</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test

</code></pre><p>If you have each of the above commands running in a different terminal then you should now be able to type messages into the producer terminal and see them appear in the consumer terminal.</p><p>All of the command line tools have additional options; running the command with no arguments will display usage information documenting them in more detail.</p><h2 id=step-6-setting-up-a-multi-broker-cluster>Step 6: Setting up a multi-broker cluster<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-6-setting-up-a-multi-broker-cluster aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>So far we have been running against a single broker, but that&rsquo;s no fun. For Kafka, a single broker is just a cluster of size one, so nothing much changes other than starting a few more broker instances. But just to get feel for it, let&rsquo;s expand our cluster to three nodes (still all on our local machine).</p><p>First we make a config file for each of the brokers (on Windows use the <code>copy</code> command instead):</p><pre><code>&gt; cp config/server.properties config/server-1.properties
&gt; cp config/server.properties config/server-2.properties
</code></pre><p>Now edit these new files and set the following properties:</p><pre><code>config/server-1.properties:
    broker.id=1
    listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9093
    log.dir=/tmp/kafka-logs-1

config/server-2.properties:
    broker.id=2
    listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9094
    log.dir=/tmp/kafka-logs-2
</code></pre><p>The <code>broker.id</code> property is the unique and permanent name of each node in the cluster. We have to override the port and log directory only because we are running these all on the same machine and we want to keep the brokers from all trying to register on the same port or overwrite each other&rsquo;s data.</p><p>We already have Zookeeper and our single node started, so we just need to start the two new nodes:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-1.properties &amp;
...
&gt; bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-2.properties &amp;
...
</code></pre><p>Now create a new topic with a replication factor of three:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 1 --topic my-replicated-topic
</code></pre><p>Okay but now that we have a cluster how can we know which broker is doing what? To see that run the &ldquo;describe topics&rdquo; command:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic my-replicated-topic
Topic:my-replicated-topic	PartitionCount:1	ReplicationFactor:3	Configs:
	Topic: my-replicated-topic	Partition: 0	Leader: 1	Replicas: 1,2,0	Isr: 1,2,0
</code></pre><p>Here is an explanation of output. The first line gives a summary of all the partitions, each additional line gives information about one partition. Since we have only one partition for this topic there is only one line.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;leader&rdquo; is the node responsible for all reads and writes for the given partition. Each node will be the leader for a randomly selected portion of the partitions.</li><li>&ldquo;replicas&rdquo; is the list of nodes that replicate the log for this partition regardless of whether they are the leader or even if they are currently alive.</li><li>&ldquo;isr&rdquo; is the set of &ldquo;in-sync&rdquo; replicas. This is the subset of the replicas list that is currently alive and caught-up to the leader.</li></ul><p>Note that in my example node 1 is the leader for the only partition of the topic.</p><p>We can run the same command on the original topic we created to see where it is:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test
Topic:test	PartitionCount:1	ReplicationFactor:1	Configs:
	Topic: test	Partition: 0	Leader: 0	Replicas: 0	Isr: 0
</code></pre><p>So there is no surprise there&ndash;the original topic has no replicas and is on server 0, the only server in our cluster when we created it.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s publish a few messages to our new topic:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-replicated-topic
...
my test message 1
my test message 2
^C
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s consume these messages:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning --topic my-replicated-topic
...
my test message 1
my test message 2
^C
</code></pre><p>Now let&rsquo;s test out fault-tolerance. Broker 1 was acting as the leader so let&rsquo;s kill it:</p><pre><code>&gt; ps aux | grep server-1.properties
7564 ttys002    0:15.91 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.8/Home/bin/java...
&gt; kill -9 7564
</code></pre><p>On Windows use:</p><pre><code>&gt; wmic process get processid,caption,commandline | find &quot;java.exe&quot; | find &quot;server-1.properties&quot;

&gt; taskkill /pid 644 /f
</code></pre><p>Leadership has switched to one of the slaves and node 1 is no longer in the in-sync replica set:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic my-replicated-topic

	Topic: my-replicated-topic	Partition: 0	Leader: 2	Replicas: 1,2,0	Isr: 2,0
</code></pre><p>But the messages are still available for consumption even though the leader that took the writes originally is down:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning --topic my-replicated-topic
...

For many systems, instead of writing custom integration code you can use Kafka Connect to import or export data.</p><p>Kafka Connect is a tool included with Kafka that imports and exports data to Kafka. It is an extensible tool that runs <em>connectors</em> , which implement the custom logic for interacting with an external system. In this quickstart we&rsquo;ll see how to run Kafka Connect with simple connectors that import data from a file to a Kafka topic and export data from a Kafka topic to a file.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll start by creating some seed data to test with:</p><pre><code>&gt; echo -e &quot;foo
bar&quot; &gt; test.txt
</code></pre><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll start two connectors running in <em>standalone</em> mode, which means they run in a single, local, dedicated process. We provide three configuration files as parameters. The first is always the configuration for the Kafka Connect process, containing common configuration such as the Kafka brokers to connect to and the serialization format for data. The remaining configuration files each specify a connector to create. These files include a unique connector name, the connector class to instantiate, and any other configuration required by the connector.</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties
</code></pre><p>These sample configuration files, included with Kafka, use the default local cluster configuration you started earlier and create two connectors: the first is a source connector that reads lines from an input file and produces each to a Kafka topic and the second is a sink connector that reads messages from a Kafka topic and produces each as a line in an output file.</p><p>During startup you&rsquo;ll see a number of log messages, including some indicating that the connectors are being instantiated. Once the Kafka Connect process has started, the source connector should start reading lines from <code>test.txt</code> and producing them to the topic <code>connect-test</code>, and the sink connector should start reading messages from the topic <code>connect-test</code> and write them to the file <code>test.sink.txt</code>. We can verify the data has been delivered through the entire pipeline by examining the contents of the output file:</p><pre><code>&gt; cat test.sink.txt
foo
bar
</code></pre><p>Note that the data is being stored in the Kafka topic <code>connect-test</code>, so we can also run a console consumer to see the data in the topic (or use custom consumer code to process it):</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic connect-test --from-beginning
{&quot;schema&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;optional&quot;:false},&quot;payload&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;}
{&quot;schema&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;optional&quot;:false},&quot;payload&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}
...
</code></pre><p>The connectors continue to process data, so we can add data to the file and see it move through the pipeline:</p><pre><code>&gt; echo &quot;Another line&quot; &gt;&gt; test.txt
</code></pre><p>You should see the line appear in the console consumer output and in the sink file.</p><h2 id=step-8-use-kafka-streams-to-process-data>Step 8: Use Kafka Streams to process data<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-8-use-kafka-streams-to-process-data aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka Streams is a client library for building mission-critical real-time applications and microservices, where the input and/or output data is stored in Kafka clusters. Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka&rsquo;s server-side cluster technology to make these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed, and much more. This <a href=/0110/streams/quickstart/>quickstart example</a> will demonstrate how to run a streaming application coded in this library.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-dc309443a47f65e6d27fb86cbb02258c>1.4 - Ecosystem</h1><p>There are a plethora of tools that integrate with Kafka outside the main distribution.

By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 0.11.0.0 before upgrading.</p><p>Starting with version 0.10.2, Java clients (producer and consumer) have acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.11.0 clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. However, if your brokers are older than 0.10.0, you must upgrade all the brokers in the Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. Version 0.11.0 brokers support 0.8.x and newer clients.</p><p><strong>For a rolling upgrade:</strong></p><ol><li>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the current message format version currently in use.

Note that the older Scala consumer does not support the new message format, so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the new Java consumer must be used.</li></ol><p><strong>Additional Upgrade Notes:</strong></p><ol><li>If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will start with the new protocol by default.</li><li>Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after. Similarly for the message format version.</li><li>It is also possible to enable the 0.11.0 message format on individual topics using the topic admin tool (<code>bin/kafka-topics.sh</code>) prior to updating the global setting <code>log.message.format.version</code>.</li><li>If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.10.0, it is NOT necessary to first update the message format to 0.10.0 before you switch to 0.11.0.</li></ol><h3 id=upgrading-a-0102-kafka-streams-application>Upgrading a 0.10.2 Kafka Streams Application<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#upgrading-a-0102-kafka-streams-application aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li>Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.2 to 0.11.0 does not require a broker upgrade.

The new default favors durability over availability. Users who wish to to retain the previous behavior should set the broker config <code>unclean.leader.election.enable</code> to <code>true</code>.</li><li>Producer configs <code>block.on.buffer.full</code>, <code>metadata.fetch.timeout.ms</code> and <code>timeout.ms</code> have been removed. They were initially deprecated in Kafka 0.9.0.0.</li><li>The <code>offsets.topic.replication.factor</code> broker config is now enforced upon auto topic creation. Internal auto topic creation will fail with a GROUP_COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error until the cluster size meets this replication factor requirement.</li><li>When compressing data with snappy, the producer and broker will use the compression scheme&rsquo;s default block size (2 x 32 KB) instead of 1 KB in order to improve the compression ratio. There have been reports of data compressed with the smaller block size being 50% larger than when compressed with the larger block size. For the snappy case, a producer with 5000 partitions will require an additional 315 MB of JVM heap.</li><li>Similarly, when compressing data with gzip, the producer and broker will use 8 KB instead of 1 KB as the buffer size. The default for gzip is excessively low (512 bytes).</li><li>The broker configuration <code>max.message.bytes</code> now applies to the total size of a batch of messages. Previously the setting applied to batches of compressed messages, or to non-compressed messages individually. A message batch may consist of only a single message, so in most cases, the limitation on the size of individual messages is only reduced by the overhead of the batch format. However, there are some subtle implications for message format conversion (see below for more detail). Note also that while previously the broker would ensure that at least one message is returned in each fetch request (regardless of the total and partition-level fetch sizes), the same behavior now applies to one message batch.</li><li>GC log rotation is enabled by default, see KAFKA-3754 for details.</li><li>Deprecated constructors of RecordMetadata, MetricName and Cluster classes have been removed.</li><li>Added user headers support through a new Headers interface providing user headers read and write access.</li><li>ProducerRecord and ConsumerRecord expose the new Headers API via <code>Headers headers()</code> method call.</li><li>ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer interfaces are introduced to support serialization and deserialization for headers. Headers will be ignored if the configured serializer and deserializer are not the above classes.</li><li>A new config, <code>group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms</code>, was introduced. This config specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the <code>GroupCoordinator</code> will delay the initial consumer rebalance. The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of <code>group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms</code> as new members join the group, up to a maximum of <code>max.poll.interval.ms</code>. The default value for this is 3 seconds. During development and testing it might be desirable to set this to 0 inorder to not delay test execution time.</li><li><code>org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster#partitionsForTopic</code>, <code>partitionsForNode</code> and <code>availablePartitionsForTopic</code> methods will return an empty list instead of <code>null</code> (which is considered a bad practice) in case the metadata for the required topic does not exist.</li><li>Streams API configuration parameters <code>timestamp.extractor</code>, <code>key.serde</code>, and <code>value.serde</code> were deprecated and replaced by <code>default.timestamp.extractor</code>, <code>default.key.serde</code>, and <code>default.value.serde</code>, respectively.</li><li>For offset commit failures in the Java consumer&rsquo;s <code>commitAsync</code> APIs, we no longer expose the underlying cause when instances of <code>RetriableCommitFailedException</code> are passed to the commit callback.

Idempotent delivery ensures that messages are delivered exactly once to a particular topic partition during the lifetime of a single producer. Transactional delivery allows producers to send data to multiple partitions such that either all messages are successfully delivered, or none of them are. Together, these capabilities enable &ldquo;exactly once semantics&rdquo; in Kafka. More details on these features are available in the user guide, but below we add a few specific notes on enabling them in an upgraded cluster. Note that enabling EoS is not required and there is no impact on the broker&rsquo;s behavior if unused.</p><ol><li>Only the new Java producer and consumer support exactly once semantics.</li><li>These features depend crucially on the 0.11.0 message format. Attempting to use them on an older format will result in unsupported version errors.</li><li>Transaction state is stored in a new internal topic <code>__transaction_state</code>. This topic is not created until the the first attempt to use a transactional request API. Similar to the consumer offsets topic, there are several settings to control the topic&rsquo;s configuration. For example, <code>transaction.state.log.min.isr</code> controls the minimum ISR for this topic. See the configuration section in the user guide for a full list of options.</li><li>For secure clusters, the transactional APIs require new ACLs which can be turned on with the <code>bin/kafka-acls.sh</code>. tool.</li><li>EoS in Kafka introduces new request APIs and modifies several existing ones. See <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging#KIP-98-ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-RPCProtocolSummary>KIP-98</a> for the full details`</li></ol><h3 id=notes-on-the-new-message-format-in-0110>Notes on the new message format in 0.11.0<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#notes-on-the-new-message-format-in-0110 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The 0.11.0 message format includes several major enhancements in order to support better delivery semantics for the producer (see <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging>KIP-98</a>) and improved replication fault tolerance (see <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-101+-+Alter+Replication+Protocol+to+use+Leader+Epoch+rather+than+High+Watermark+for+Truncation>KIP-101</a>). Although the new format contains more information to make these improvements possible, we have made the batch format much more efficient. As long as the number of messages per batch is more than 2, you can expect lower overall overhead. For smaller batches, however, there may be a small performance impact. See <a href=bit.ly/kafka-eos-perf>here</a> for the results of our initial performance analysis of the new message format. You can also find more detail on the message format in the <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging#KIP-98-ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-MessageFormat>KIP-98</a> proposal.</p><p>One of the notable differences in the new message format is that even uncompressed messages are stored together as a single batch. This has a few implications for the broker configuration <code>max.message.bytes</code>, which limits the size of a single batch. First, if an older client produces messages to a topic partition using the old format, and the messages are individually smaller than <code>max.message.bytes</code>, the broker may still reject them after they are merged into a single batch during the up-conversion process. Generally this can happen when the aggregate size of the individual messages is larger than <code>max.message.bytes</code>. There is a similar effect for older consumers reading messages down-converted from the new format: if the fetch size is not set at least as large as <code>max.message.bytes</code>, the consumer may not be able to make progress even if the individual uncompressed messages are smaller than the configured fetch size. This behavior does not impact the Java client for 0.10.1.0 and later since it uses an updated fetch protocol which ensures that at least one message can be returned even if it exceeds the fetch size. To get around these problems, you should ensure 1) that the producer&rsquo;s batch size is not set larger than <code>max.message.bytes</code>, and 2) that the consumer&rsquo;s fetch size is set at least as large as <code>max.message.bytes</code>.</p><p>Most of the discussion on the performance impact of upgrading to the 0.10.0 message format remains pertinent to the 0.11.0 upgrade. This mainly affects clusters that are not secured with TLS since &ldquo;zero-copy&rdquo; transfer is already not possible in that case. In order to avoid the cost of down-conversion, you should ensure that consumer applications are upgraded to the latest 0.11.0 client. Significantly, since the old consumer has been deprecated in 0.11.0.0, it does not support the new message format. You must upgrade to use the new consumer to use the new message format without the cost of down-conversion. Note that 0.11.0 consumers support backwards compability with brokers 0.10.0 brokers and upward, so it is possible to upgrade the clients first before the brokers.</p><h2 id=upgrading-from-08x-09x-0100x-or-0101x-to-01020>Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x or 0.10.1.x to 0.10.2.0<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#upgrading-from-08x-09x-0100x-or-0101x-to-01020 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>0.10.2.0 has wire protocol changes.

Thus, you need to update and recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.</li><li>Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1 requires an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)<ul><li>stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances</li><li>update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code and new jar file</li><li>restart all new (0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1) application instances</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=notable-changes-in-01010>Notable changes in 0.10.1.0<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#notable-changes-in-01010 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li>The new Java consumer is no longer in beta and we recommend it for all new development. The old Scala consumers are still supported, but they will be deprecated in the next release and will be removed in a future major release.</li><li>The <code>\--new-consumer</code>/<code>\--new.consumer</code> switch is no longer required to use tools like MirrorMaker and the Console Consumer with the new consumer; one simply needs to pass a Kafka broker to connect to instead of the ZooKeeper ensemble. In addition, usage of the Console Consumer with the old consumer has been deprecated and it will be removed in a future major release.</li><li>Kafka clusters can now be uniquely identified by a cluster id. It will be automatically generated when a broker is upgraded to 0.10.1.0. The cluster id is available via the kafka.server:type=KafkaServer,name=ClusterId metric and it is part of the Metadata response. Serializers, client interceptors and metric reporters can receive the cluster id by implementing the ClusterResourceListener interface.</li><li>The BrokerState &ldquo;RunningAsController&rdquo; (value 4) has been removed. Due to a bug, a broker would only be in this state briefly before transitioning out of it and hence the impact of the removal should be minimal. The recommended way to detect if a given broker is the controller is via the kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ActiveControllerCount metric.</li><li>The new Java Consumer now allows users to search offsets by timestamp on partitions.</li><li>The new Java Consumer now supports heartbeating from a background thread. There is a new configuration <code>max.poll.interval.ms</code> which controls the maximum time between poll invocations before the consumer will proactively leave the group (5 minutes by default). The value of the configuration <code>request.timeout.ms</code> must always be larger than <code>max.poll.interval.ms</code> because this is the maximum time that a JoinGroup request can block on the server while the consumer is rebalancing, so we have changed its default value to just above 5 minutes. Finally, the default value of <code>session.timeout.ms</code> has been adjusted down to 10 seconds, and the default value of <code>max.poll.records</code> has been changed to 500.</li><li>When using an Authorizer and a user doesn&rsquo;t have <strong>Describe</strong> authorization on a topic, the broker will no longer return TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED errors to requests since this leaks topic names. Instead, the UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error code will be returned. This may cause unexpected timeouts or delays when using the producer and consumer since Kafka clients will typically retry automatically on unknown topic errors. You should consult the client logs if you suspect this could be happening.</li><li>Fetch responses have a size limit by default (50 MB for consumers and 10 MB for replication). The existing per partition limits also apply (1 MB for consumers and replication). Note that neither of these limits is an absolute maximum as explained in the next point.</li><li>Consumers and replicas can make progress if a message larger than the response/partition size limit is found. More concretely, if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than either or both limits, the message will still be returned.</li><li>Overloaded constructors were added to <code>kafka.api.FetchRequest</code> and <code>kafka.javaapi.FetchRequest</code> to allow the caller to specify the order of the partitions (since order is significant in v3). The previously existing constructors were deprecated and the partitions are shuffled before the request is sent to avoid starvation issues.</li></ul><h3 id=new-protocol-versions-2>New Protocol Versions<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#new-protocol-versions-2 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li>ListOffsetRequest v1 supports accurate offset search based on timestamps.</li><li>MetadataResponse v2 introduces a new field: &ldquo;cluster_id&rdquo;.</li><li>FetchRequest v3 supports limiting the response size (in addition to the existing per partition limit), it returns messages bigger than the limits if required to make progress and the order of partitions in the request is now significant.</li><li>JoinGroup v1 introduces a new field: &ldquo;rebalance_timeout&rdquo;.</li></ul><h2 id=upgrading-from-08x-or-09x-to-01000>Upgrading from 0.8.x or 0.9.x to 0.10.0.0<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#upgrading-from-08x-or-09x-to-01000 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>0.10.0.0 has potential breaking changes (please review before upgrading) and possible performance impact following the upgrade. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime and no performance impact during and following the upgrade.<br>Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients.</p><p><strong>Notes to clients with version 0.9.0.0:</strong> Due to a bug introduced in 0.9.0.0, clients that depend on ZooKeeper (old Scala high-level Consumer and MirrorMaker if used with the old consumer) will not work with 0.10.0.x brokers. Therefore, 0.9.0.0 clients should be upgraded to 0.9.0.1 <strong>before</strong> brokers are upgraded to 0.10.0.x. This step is not necessary for 0.8.X or 0.9.0.1 clients.</p><p><strong>For a rolling upgrade:</strong></p><ol><li>Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following properties:<ul><li>inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2 or 0.9.0.0).</li><li>log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)</li></ul></li><li>Upgrade the brokers.

The on disk message format can be configured through log.message.format.version in the server.properties file. The default on-disk message format is 0.10.0. If a consumer client is on a version before 0.10.0.0, it only understands message formats before 0.10.0. In this case, the broker is able to convert messages from the 0.10.0 format to an earlier format before sending the response to the consumer on an older version. However, the broker can&rsquo;t use zero-copy transfer in this case. Reports from the Kafka community on the performance impact have shown CPU utilization going from 20% before to 100% after an upgrade, which forced an immediate upgrade of all clients to bring performance back to normal. To avoid such message conversion before consumers are upgraded to 0.10.0.0, one can set log.message.format.version to 0.8.2 or 0.9.0 when upgrading the broker to 0.10.0.0. This way, the broker can still use zero-copy transfer to send the data to the old consumers. Once consumers are upgraded, one can change the message format to 0.10.0 on the broker and enjoy the new message format that includes new timestamp and improved compression. The conversion is supported to ensure compatibility and can be useful to support a few apps that have not updated to newer clients yet, but is impractical to support all consumer traffic on even an overprovisioned cluster. Therefore, it is critical to avoid the message conversion as much as possible when brokers have been upgraded but the majority of clients have not.</p><p>For clients that are upgraded to 0.10.0.0, there is no performance impact.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> By setting the message format version, one certifies that all existing messages are on or below that message format version. Otherwise consumers before 0.10.0.0 might break. In particular, after the message format is set to 0.10.0, one should not change it back to an earlier format as it may break consumers on versions before 0.10.0.0.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the additional timestamp introduced in each message, producers sending small messages may see a message throughput degradation because of the increased overhead. Likewise, replication now transmits an additional 8 bytes per message. If you&rsquo;re running close to the network capacity of your cluster, it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ll overwhelm the network cards and see failures and performance issues due to the overload.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have enabled compression on producers, you may notice reduced producer throughput and/or lower compression rate on the broker in some cases. When receiving compressed messages, 0.10.0 brokers avoid recompressing the messages, which in general reduces the latency and improves the throughput. In certain cases, however, this may reduce the batching size on the producer, which could lead to worse throughput. If this happens, users can tune linger.ms and batch.size of the producer for better throughput. In addition, the producer buffer used for compressing messages with snappy is smaller than the one used by the broker, which may have a negative impact on the compression ratio for the messages on disk. We intend to make this configurable in a future Kafka release.</p><h3 id=potential-breaking-changes-in-01000>Potential breaking changes in 0.10.0.0<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#potential-breaking-changes-in-01000 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li>Starting from Kafka 0.10.0.0, the message format version in Kafka is represented as the Kafka version.

Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay&mdash;that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get <code>batch.size</code> worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay).

(i.e., the partition ownership counts will be within a delta of exactly one across all consumer threads.) Round-robin assignment is permitted only if: (a) Every topic has the same number of streams within a consumer instance (b) The set of subscribed topics is identical for every consumer instance within the group. Range partitioning works on a per-topic basis. For each topic, we lay out the available partitions in numeric order and the consumer threads in lexicographic order. We then divide the number of partitions by the total number of consumer streams (threads) to determine the number of partitions to assign to each consumer.

To do this we had to think through a fairly broad set of use cases.</p><p>It would have to have high-throughput to support high volume event streams such as real-time log aggregation.</p><p>It would need to deal gracefully with large data backlogs to be able to support periodic data loads from offline systems.</p><p>It also meant the system would have to handle low-latency delivery to handle more traditional messaging use-cases.</p><p>We wanted to support partitioned, distributed, real-time processing of these feeds to create new, derived feeds. This motivated our partitioning and consumer model.</p><p>Finally in cases where the stream is fed into other data systems for serving, we knew the system would have to be able to guarantee fault-tolerance in the presence of machine failures.</p><p>Supporting these uses led us to a design with a number of unique elements, more akin to a database log than a traditional messaging system. We will outline some elements of the design in the following sections.</p><h1 id=persistence>Persistence<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#persistence aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=dont-fear-the-filesystem>Don&rsquo;t fear the filesystem!<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#dont-fear-the-filesystem aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka relies heavily on the filesystem for storing and caching messages. There is a general perception that &ldquo;disks are slow&rdquo; which makes people skeptical that a persistent structure can offer competitive performance. In fact disks are both much slower and much faster than people expect depending on how they are used; and a properly designed disk structure can often be as fast as the network.</p><p>The key fact about disk performance is that the throughput of hard drives has been diverging from the latency of a disk seek for the last decade. As a result the performance of linear writes on a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures>JBOD</a> configuration with six 7200rpm SATA RAID-5 array is about 600MB/sec but the performance of random writes is only about 100k/sec&ndash;a difference of over 6000X. These linear reads and writes are the most predictable of all usage patterns, and are heavily optimized by the operating system. A modern operating system provides read-ahead and write-behind techniques that prefetch data in large block multiples and group smaller logical writes into large physical writes. A further discussion of this issue can be found in this <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874">ACM Queue article</a>; they actually find that <a href=http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1563874/jacobs3.jpg>sequential disk access can in some cases be faster than random memory access!</a></p><p>To compensate for this performance divergence, modern operating systems have become increasingly aggressive in their use of main memory for disk caching. A modern OS will happily divert <em>all</em> free memory to disk caching with little performance penalty when the memory is reclaimed. All disk reads and writes will go through this unified cache. This feature cannot easily be turned off without using direct I/O, so even if a process maintains an in-process cache of the data, this data will likely be duplicated in OS pagecache, effectively storing everything twice.</p><p>Furthermore, we are building on top of the JVM, and anyone who has spent any time with Java memory usage knows two things:</p><ol><li>The memory overhead of objects is very high, often doubling the size of the data stored (or worse).</li><li>Java garbage collection becomes increasingly fiddly and slow as the in-heap data increases.</li></ol><p>As a result of these factors using the filesystem and relying on pagecache is superior to maintaining an in-memory cache or other structure&ndash;we at least double the available cache by having automatic access to all free memory, and likely double again by storing a compact byte structure rather than individual objects. Doing so will result in a cache of up to 28-30GB on a 32GB machine without GC penalties. Furthermore, this cache will stay warm even if the service is restarted, whereas the in-process cache will need to be rebuilt in memory (which for a 10GB cache may take 10 minutes) or else it will need to start with a completely cold cache (which likely means terrible initial performance). This also greatly simplifies the code as all logic for maintaining coherency between the cache and filesystem is now in the OS, which tends to do so more efficiently and more correctly than one-off in-process attempts. If your disk usage favors linear reads then read-ahead is effectively pre-populating this cache with useful data on each disk read.</p><p>This suggests a design which is very simple: rather than maintain as much as possible in-memory and flush it all out to the filesystem in a panic when we run out of space, we invert that. All data is immediately written to a persistent log on the filesystem without necessarily flushing to disk. In effect this just means that it is transferred into the kernel&rsquo;s pagecache.</p><p>This style of pagecache-centric design is described in an <a href=http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes>article</a> on the design of Varnish here (along with a healthy dose of arrogance).</p><h2 id=constant-time-suffices>Constant Time Suffices<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#constant-time-suffices aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The persistent data structure used in messaging systems are often a per-consumer queue with an associated BTree or other general-purpose random access data structures to maintain metadata about messages. BTrees are the most versatile data structure available, and make it possible to support a wide variety of transactional and non-transactional semantics in the messaging system. They do come with a fairly high cost, though: Btree operations are O(log N). Normally O(log N) is considered essentially equivalent to constant time, but this is not true for disk operations. Disk seeks come at 10 ms a pop, and each disk can do only one seek at a time so parallelism is limited. Hence even a handful of disk seeks leads to very high overhead. Since storage systems mix very fast cached operations with very slow physical disk operations, the observed performance of tree structures is often superlinear as data increases with fixed cache&ndash;i.e. doubling your data makes things much worse than twice as slow.</p><p>Intuitively a persistent queue could be built on simple reads and appends to files as is commonly the case with logging solutions. This structure has the advantage that all operations are O(1) and reads do not block writes or each other. This has obvious performance advantages since the performance is completely decoupled from the data size&ndash;one server can now take full advantage of a number of cheap, low-rotational speed 1+TB SATA drives. Though they have poor seek performance, these drives have acceptable performance for large reads and writes and come at 1/3 the price and 3x the capacity.</p><p>Having access to virtually unlimited disk space without any performance penalty means that we can provide some features not usually found in a messaging system. For example, in Kafka, instead of attempting to delete messages as soon as they are consumed, we can retain messages for a relatively long period (say a week). This leads to a great deal of flexibility for consumers, as we will describe.</p><h1 id=efficiency>Efficiency<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#efficiency aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>We have put significant effort into efficiency. One of our primary use cases is handling web activity data, which is very high volume: each page view may generate dozens of writes. Furthermore, we assume each message published is read by at least one consumer (often many), hence we strive to make consumption as cheap as possible.</p><p>We have also found, from experience building and running a number of similar systems, that efficiency is a key to effective multi-tenant operations. If the downstream infrastructure service can easily become a bottleneck due to a small bump in usage by the application, such small changes will often create problems. By being very fast we help ensure that the application will tip-over under load before the infrastructure. This is particularly important when trying to run a centralized service that supports dozens or hundreds of applications on a centralized cluster as changes in usage patterns are a near-daily occurrence.</p><p>We discussed disk efficiency in the previous section. Once poor disk access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of inefficiency in this type of system: too many small I/O operations, and excessive byte copying.</p><p>The small I/O problem happens both between the client and the server and in the server&rsquo;s own persistent operations.</p><p>To avoid this, our protocol is built around a &ldquo;message set&rdquo; abstraction that naturally groups messages together. This allows network requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the network roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. The server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.</p><p>This simple optimization produces orders of magnitude speed up. Batching leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks, and so on, all of which allows Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes that flow to the consumers.</p><p>The other inefficiency is in byte copying. At low message rates this is not an issue, but under load the impact is significant. To avoid this we employ a standardized binary message format that is shared by the producer, the broker, and the consumer (so data chunks can be transferred without modification between them).</p><p>The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer. Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. Modern unix operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring data out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the <a href=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html>sendfile system call</a>.</p><p>To understand the impact of sendfile, it is important to understand the common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:</p><ol><li>The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in kernel space</li><li>The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space buffer</li><li>The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket buffer</li><li>The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the NIC buffer where it is sent over the network</li></ol><p>This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls. Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send the data from pagecache to the network directly. So in this optimized path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.</p><p>We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic. Using the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory and copied out to user-space every time it is read. This allows messages to be consumed at a rate that approaches the limit of the network connection.</p><p>This combination of pagecache and sendfile means that on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from cache.</p><p>For more background on the sendfile and zero-copy support in Java, see this <a href=https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-zerocopy/>article</a>.</p><h2 id=end-to-end-batch-compression>End-to-end Batch Compression<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#end-to-end-batch-compression aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>In some cases the bottleneck is actually not CPU or disk but network bandwidth. This is particularly true for a data pipeline that needs to send messages between data centers over a wide-area network. Of course, the user can always compress its messages one at a time without any support needed from Kafka, but this can lead to very poor compression ratios as much of the redundancy is due to repetition between messages of the same type (e.g. field names in JSON or user agents in web logs or common string values). Efficient compression requires compressing multiple messages together rather than compressing each message individually.</p><p>Kafka supports this with an efficient batching format. A batch of messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in this form. This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and will remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the consumer.</p><p>Kafka supports GZIP, Snappy and LZ4 compression protocols. More details on compression can be found <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compression>here</a>.</p><h1 id=the-producer>The Producer<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-producer aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=load-balancing>Load balancing<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#load-balancing aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The producer sends data directly to the broker that is the leader for the partition without any intervening routing tier. To help the producer do this all Kafka nodes can answer a request for metadata about which servers are alive and where the leaders for the partitions of a topic are at any given time to allow the producer to appropriately direct its requests.</p><p>The client controls which partition it publishes messages to. This can be done at random, implementing a kind of random load balancing, or it can be done by some semantic partitioning function. We expose the interface for semantic partitioning by allowing the user to specify a key to partition by and using this to hash to a partition (there is also an option to override the partition function if need be). For example if the key chosen was a user id then all data for a given user would be sent to the same partition. This in turn will allow consumers to make locality assumptions about their consumption. This style of partitioning is explicitly designed to allow locality-sensitive processing in consumers.</p><h2 id=asynchronous-send>Asynchronous send<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#asynchronous-send aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Batching is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send out larger batches in a single request. The batching can be configured to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms). This allows the accumulation of more bytes to send, and few larger I/O operations on the servers. This buffering is configurable and gives a mechanism to trade off a small amount of additional latency for better throughput.</p><p>Details on configuration and the <a href=/http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html>api</a> for the producer can be found elsewhere in the documentation.</p><h1 id=the-consumer>The Consumer<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-consumer aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>The Kafka consumer works by issuing &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; requests to the brokers leading the partitions it wants to consume. The consumer specifies its offset in the log with each request and receives back a chunk of log beginning from that position. The consumer thus has significant control over this position and can rewind it to re-consume data if need be.</p><h2 id=push-vs-pull>Push vs. pull<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#push-vs-pull aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>An initial question we considered is whether consumers should pull data from brokers or brokers should push data to the consumer. In this respect Kafka follows a more traditional design, shared by most messaging systems, where data is pushed to the broker from the producer and pulled from the broker by the consumer. Some logging-centric systems, such as <a href=http://github.com/facebook/scribe>Scribe</a> and <a href=http://flume.apache.org/>Apache Flume</a>, follow a very different push-based path where data is pushed downstream. There are pros and cons to both approaches. However, a push-based system has difficulty dealing with diverse consumers as the broker controls the rate at which data is transferred. The goal is generally for the consumer to be able to consume at the maximum possible rate; unfortunately, in a push system this means the consumer tends to be overwhelmed when its rate of consumption falls below the rate of production (a denial of service attack, in essence). A pull-based system has the nicer property that the consumer simply falls behind and catches up when it can. This can be mitigated with some kind of backoff protocol by which the consumer can indicate it is overwhelmed, but getting the rate of transfer to fully utilize (but never over-utilize) the consumer is trickier than it seems. Previous attempts at building systems in this fashion led us to go with a more traditional pull model.</p><p>Another advantage of a pull-based system is that it lends itself to aggressive batching of data sent to the consumer. A push-based system must choose to either send a request immediately or accumulate more data and then send it later without knowledge of whether the downstream consumer will be able to immediately process it. If tuned for low latency, this will result in sending a single message at a time only for the transfer to end up being buffered anyway, which is wasteful. A pull-based design fixes this as the consumer always pulls all available messages after its current position in the log (or up to some configurable max size). So one gets optimal batching without introducing unnecessary latency.</p><p>The deficiency of a naive pull-based system is that if the broker has no data the consumer may end up polling in a tight loop, effectively busy-waiting for data to arrive. To avoid this we have parameters in our pull request that allow the consumer request to block in a &ldquo;long poll&rdquo; waiting until data arrives (and optionally waiting until a given number of bytes is available to ensure large transfer sizes).</p><p>You could imagine other possible designs which would be only pull, end-to-end. The producer would locally write to a local log, and brokers would pull from that with consumers pulling from them. A similar type of &ldquo;store-and-forward&rdquo; producer is often proposed. This is intriguing but we felt not very suitable for our target use cases which have thousands of producers. Our experience running persistent data systems at scale led us to feel that involving thousands of disks in the system across many applications would not actually make things more reliable and would be a nightmare to operate. And in practice we have found that we can run a pipeline with strong SLAs at large scale without a need for producer persistence.</p><h2 id=consumer-position>Consumer Position<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#consumer-position aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Keeping track of <em>what</em> has been consumed is, surprisingly, one of the key performance points of a messaging system.</p><p>Most messaging systems keep metadata about what messages have been consumed on the broker. That is, as a message is handed out to a consumer, the broker either records that fact locally immediately or it may wait for acknowledgement from the consumer. This is a fairly intuitive choice, and indeed for a single machine server it is not clear where else this state could go. Since the data structures used for storage in many messaging systems scale poorly, this is also a pragmatic choice&ndash;since the broker knows what is consumed it can immediately delete it, keeping the data size small.</p><p>What is perhaps not obvious is that getting the broker and consumer to come into agreement about what has been consumed is not a trivial problem. If the broker records a message as <strong>consumed</strong> immediately every time it is handed out over the network, then if the consumer fails to process the message (say because it crashes or the request times out or whatever) that message will be lost. To solve this problem, many messaging systems add an acknowledgement feature which means that messages are only marked as <strong>sent</strong> not <strong>consumed</strong> when they are sent; the broker waits for a specific acknowledgement from the consumer to record the message as <strong>consumed</strong>. This strategy fixes the problem of losing messages, but creates new problems. First of all, if the consumer processes the message but fails before it can send an acknowledgement then the message will be consumed twice. The second problem is around performance, now the broker must keep multiple states about every single message (first to lock it so it is not given out a second time, and then to mark it as permanently consumed so that it can be removed). Tricky problems must be dealt with, like what to do with messages that are sent but never acknowledged.</p><p>Kafka handles this differently. Our topic is divided into a set of totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by exactly one consumer within each subscribing consumer group at any given time. This means that the position of a consumer in each partition is just a single integer, the offset of the next message to consume. This makes the state about what has been consumed very small, just one number for each partition. This state can be periodically checkpointed. This makes the equivalent of message acknowledgements very cheap.</p><p>There is a side benefit of this decision. A consumer can deliberately <em>rewind</em> back to an old offset and re-consume data. This violates the common contract of a queue, but turns out to be an essential feature for many consumers. For example, if the consumer code has a bug and is discovered after some messages are consumed, the consumer can re-consume those messages once the bug is fixed.</p><h2 id=offline-data-load>Offline Data Load<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#offline-data-load aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Scalable persistence allows for the possibility of consumers that only periodically consume such as batch data loads that periodically bulk-load data into an offline system such as Hadoop or a relational data warehouse.</p><p>In the case of Hadoop we parallelize the data load by splitting the load over individual map tasks, one for each node/topic/partition combination, allowing full parallelism in the loading. Hadoop provides the task management, and tasks which fail can restart without danger of duplicate data&ndash;they simply restart from their original position.</p><h1 id=message-delivery-semantics>Message Delivery Semantics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#message-delivery-semantics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Now that we understand a little about how producers and consumers work, let&rsquo;s discuss the semantic guarantees Kafka provides between producer and consumer. Clearly there are multiple possible message delivery guarantees that could be provided:</p><ul><li><em>At most once</em> &ndash;Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.</li><li><em>At least once</em> &ndash;Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.</li><li><em>Exactly once</em> &ndash;this is what people actually want, each message is delivered once and only once.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that this breaks down into two problems: the durability guarantees for publishing a message and the guarantees when consuming a message.</p><p>Many systems claim to provide &ldquo;exactly once&rdquo; delivery semantics, but it is important to read the fine print, most of these claims are misleading (i.e. they don&rsquo;t translate to the case where consumers or producers can fail, cases where there are multiple consumer processes, or cases where data written to disk can be lost).</p><p>Kafka&rsquo;s semantics are straight-forward. When publishing a message we have a notion of the message being &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to the log. Once a published message is committed it will not be lost as long as one broker that replicates the partition to which this message was written remains &ldquo;alive&rdquo;. The definition of committed message, alive partition as well as a description of which types of failures we attempt to handle will be described in more detail in the next section. For now let&rsquo;s assume a perfect, lossless broker and try to understand the guarantees to the producer and consumer. If a producer attempts to publish a message and experiences a network error it cannot be sure if this error happened before or after the message was committed. This is similar to the semantics of inserting into a database table with an autogenerated key.</p><p>Prior to 0.11.0.0, if a producer failed to receive a response indicating that a message was committed, it had little choice but to resend the message. This provides at-least-once delivery semantics since the message may be written to the log again during resending if the original request had in fact succeeded. Since 0.11.0.0, the Kafka producer also supports an idempotent delivery option which guarantees that resending will not result in duplicate entries in the log. To achieve this, the broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a sequence number that is sent by the producer along with every message. Also beginning with 0.11.0.0, the producer supports the ability to send messages to multiple topic partitions using transaction-like semantics: i.e. either all messages are successfully written or none of them are. The main use case for this is exactly-once processing between Kafka topics (described below).</p><p>Not all use cases require such strong guarantees. For uses which are latency sensitive we allow the producer to specify the durability level it desires. If the producer specifies that it wants to wait on the message being committed this can take on the order of 10 ms. However the producer can also specify that it wants to perform the send completely asynchronously or that it wants to wait only until the leader (but not necessarily the followers) have the message.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s describe the semantics from the point-of-view of the consumer. All replicas have the exact same log with the same offsets. The consumer controls its position in this log. If the consumer never crashed it could just store this position in memory, but if the consumer fails and we want this topic partition to be taken over by another process the new process will need to choose an appropriate position from which to start processing. Let&rsquo;s say the consumer reads some messages &ndash; it has several options for processing the messages and updating its position.</p><ol><li>It can read the messages, then save its position in the log, and finally process the messages. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after saving its position but before saving the output of its message processing. In this case the process that took over processing would start at the saved position even though a few messages prior to that position had not been processed. This corresponds to &ldquo;at-most-once&rdquo; semantics as in the case of a consumer failure messages may not be processed.</li><li>It can read the messages, process the messages, and finally save its position. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after processing messages but before saving its position. In this case when the new process takes over the first few messages it receives will already have been processed. This corresponds to the &ldquo;at-least-once&rdquo; semantics in the case of consumer failure. In many cases messages have a primary key and so the updates are idempotent (receiving the same message twice just overwrites a record with another copy of itself).</li></ol><p>So what about exactly once semantics (i.e. the thing you actually want)? When consuming from a Kafka topic and producing to another topic (as in a <a href=/streams>Kafka Streams</a> application), we can leverage the new transactional producer capabilities in 0.11.0.0 that were mentioned above. The consumer&rsquo;s position is stored as a message in a topic, so we can write the offset to Kafka in the same transaction as the output topics receiving the processed data. If the transaction is aborted, the consumer&rsquo;s position will revert to its old value and the produced data on the output topics will not be visible to other consumers, depending on their &ldquo;isolation level.&rdquo; In the default &ldquo;read_uncommitted&rdquo; isolation level, all messages are visible to consumers even if they were part of an aborted transaction, but in &ldquo;read_committed,&rdquo; the consumer will only return messages from transactions which were committed (and any messages which were not part of a transaction).</p><p>When writing to an external system, the limitation is in the need to coordinate the consumer&rsquo;s position with what is actually stored as output. The classic way of achieving this would be to introduce a two-phase commit between the storage of the consumer position and the storage of the consumers output. But this can be handled more simply and generally by letting the consumer store its offset in the same place as its output. This is better because many of the output systems a consumer might want to write to will not support a two-phase commit. As an example of this, consider a <a href=/#connect>Kafka Connect</a> connector which populates data in HDFS along with the offsets of the data it reads so that it is guaranteed that either data and offsets are both updated or neither is. We follow similar patterns for many other data systems which require these stronger semantics and for which the messages do not have a primary key to allow for deduplication.</p><p>So effectively Kafka supports exactly-once delivery in <a href=/streams>Kafka Streams</a>, and the transactional producer/consumer can be used generally to provide exactly-once delivery when transfering and processing data between Kafka topics. Exactly-once delivery for other destination systems generally requires cooperation with such systems, but Kafka provides the offset which makes implementing this feasible (see also <a href=/#connect>Kafka Connect</a>). Otherwise, Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default, and allows the user to implement at-most-once delivery by disabling retries on the producer and committing offsets in the consumer prior to processing a batch of messages.</p><h1 id=replication>Replication<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#replication aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka replicates the log for each topic&rsquo;s partitions across a configurable number of servers (you can set this replication factor on a topic-by-topic basis). This allows automatic failover to these replicas when a server in the cluster fails so messages remain available in the presence of failures.</p><p>Other messaging systems provide some replication-related features, but, in our (totally biased) opinion, this appears to be a tacked-on thing, not heavily used, and with large downsides: slaves are inactive, throughput is heavily impacted, it requires fiddly manual configuration, etc. Kafka is meant to be used with replication by default&ndash;in fact we implement un-replicated topics as replicated topics where the replication factor is one.</p><p>The unit of replication is the topic partition. Under non-failure conditions, each partition in Kafka has a single leader and zero or more followers. The total number of replicas including the leader constitute the replication factor. All reads and writes go to the leader of the partition. Typically, there are many more partitions than brokers and the leaders are evenly distributed among brokers. The logs on the followers are identical to the leader&rsquo;s log&ndash;all have the same offsets and messages in the same order (though, of course, at any given time the leader may have a few as-yet unreplicated messages at the end of its log).</p><p>Followers consume messages from the leader just as a normal Kafka consumer would and apply them to their own log. Having the followers pull from the leader has the nice property of allowing the follower to naturally batch together log entries they are applying to their log.</p><p>As with most distributed systems automatically handling failures requires having a precise definition of what it means for a node to be &ldquo;alive&rdquo;. For Kafka node liveness has two conditions</p><ol><li>A node must be able to maintain its session with ZooKeeper (via ZooKeeper&rsquo;s heartbeat mechanism)</li><li>If it is a slave it must replicate the writes happening on the leader and not fall &ldquo;too far&rdquo; behind
We refer to nodes satisfying these two conditions as being &ldquo;in sync&rdquo; to avoid the vagueness of &ldquo;alive&rdquo; or &ldquo;failed&rdquo;. The leader keeps track of the set of &ldquo;in sync&rdquo; nodes. If a follower dies, gets stuck, or falls behind, the leader will remove it from the list of in sync replicas. The determination of stuck and lagging replicas is controlled by the replica.lag.time.max.ms configuration.</li></ol><p>In distributed systems terminology we only attempt to handle a &ldquo;fail/recover&rdquo; model of failures where nodes suddenly cease working and then later recover (perhaps without knowing that they have died). Kafka does not handle so-called &ldquo;Byzantine&rdquo; failures in which nodes produce arbitrary or malicious responses (perhaps due to bugs or foul play).</p><p>We can now more precisely define that a message is considered committed when all in sync replicas for that partition have applied it to their log. Only committed messages are ever given out to the consumer. This means that the consumer need not worry about potentially seeing a message that could be lost if the leader fails. Producers, on the other hand, have the option of either waiting for the message to be committed or not, depending on their preference for tradeoff between latency and durability. This preference is controlled by the acks setting that the producer uses. Note that topics have a setting for the &ldquo;minimum number&rdquo; of in-sync replicas that is checked when the producer requests acknowledgment that a message has been written to the full set of in-sync replicas. If a less stringent acknowledgement is requested by the producer, then the message can be committed, and consumed, even if the number of in-sync replicas is lower than the minimum (e.g. it can be as low as just the leader).</p><p>The guarantee that Kafka offers is that a committed message will not be lost, as long as there is at least one in sync replica alive, at all times.</p><p>Kafka will remain available in the presence of node failures after a short fail-over period, but may not remain available in the presence of network partitions.</p><h2 id=replicated-logs-quorums-isrs-and-state-machines-oh-my>Replicated Logs: Quorums, ISRs, and State Machines (Oh my!)<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#replicated-logs-quorums-isrs-and-state-machines-oh-my aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>At its heart a Kafka partition is a replicated log. The replicated log is one of the most basic primitives in distributed data systems, and there are many approaches for implementing one. A replicated log can be used by other systems as a primitive for implementing other distributed systems in the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication>state-machine style</a>.</p><p>A replicated log models the process of coming into consensus on the order of a series of values (generally numbering the log entries 0, 1, 2, &mldr;). There are many ways to implement this, but the simplest and fastest is with a leader who chooses the ordering of values provided to it. As long as the leader remains alive, all followers need to only copy the values and ordering the leader chooses.</p><p>Of course if leaders didn&rsquo;t fail we wouldn&rsquo;t need followers! When the leader does die we need to choose a new leader from among the followers. But followers themselves may fall behind or crash so we must ensure we choose an up-to-date follower. The fundamental guarantee a log replication algorithm must provide is that if we tell the client a message is committed, and the leader fails, the new leader we elect must also have that message. This yields a tradeoff: if the leader waits for more followers to acknowledge a message before declaring it committed then there will be more potentially electable leaders.</p><p>If you choose the number of acknowledgements required and the number of logs that must be compared to elect a leader such that there is guaranteed to be an overlap, then this is called a Quorum.</p><p>A common approach to this tradeoff is to use a majority vote for both the commit decision and the leader election. This is not what Kafka does, but let&rsquo;s explore it anyway to understand the tradeoffs. Let&rsquo;s say we have 2 <em>f</em> +1 replicas. If <em>f</em> +1 replicas must receive a message prior to a commit being declared by the leader, and if we elect a new leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least <em>f</em> +1 replicas, then, with no more than <em>f</em> failures, the leader is guaranteed to have all committed messages. This is because among any <em>f</em> +1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains all committed messages. That replica&rsquo;s log will be the most complete and therefore will be selected as the new leader. There are many remaining details that each algorithm must handle (such as precisely defined what makes a log more complete, ensuring log consistency during leader failure or changing the set of servers in the replica set) but we will ignore these for now.</p><p>This majority vote approach has a very nice property: the latency is dependent on only the fastest servers. That is, if the replication factor is three, the latency is determined by the faster slave not the slower one.</p><p>There are a rich variety of algorithms in this family including ZooKeeper&rsquo;s <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20140602093727/http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf>Zab</a>, <a href=https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf>Raft</a>, and <a href=http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf>Viewstamped Replication</a>. The most similar academic publication we are aware of to Kafka&rsquo;s actual implementation is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=66814">PacificA</a> from Microsoft.</p><p>The downside of majority vote is that it doesn&rsquo;t take many failures to leave you with no electable leaders. To tolerate one failure requires three copies of the data, and to tolerate two failures requires five copies of the data. In our experience having only enough redundancy to tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, but doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and 1/5th the throughput, is not very practical for large volume data problems. This is likely why quorum algorithms more commonly appear for shared cluster configuration such as ZooKeeper but are less common for primary data storage. For example in HDFS the namenode&rsquo;s high-availability feature is built on a <a href=http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1>majority-vote-based journal</a>, but this more expensive approach is not used for the data itself.</p><p>Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set. Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. Only members of this set are eligible for election as leader. A write to a Kafka partition is not considered committed until <em>all</em> in-sync replicas have received the write. This ISR set is persisted to ZooKeeper whenever it changes. Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be elected leader. This is an important factor for Kafka&rsquo;s usage model where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is important. With this ISR model and <em>f+1</em> replicas, a Kafka topic can tolerate <em>f</em> failures without losing committed messages.</p><p>For most use cases we hope to handle, we think this tradeoff is a reasonable one. In practice, to tolerate <em>f</em> failures, both the majority vote and the ISR approach will wait for the same number of replicas to acknowledge before committing a message (e.g. to survive one failure a majority quorum needs three replicas and one acknowledgement and the ISR approach requires two replicas and one acknowledgement). The ability to commit without the slowest servers is an advantage of the majority vote approach. However, we think it is ameliorated by allowing the client to choose whether they block on the message commit or not, and the additional throughput and disk space due to the lower required replication factor is worth it.</p><p>Another important design distinction is that Kafka does not require that crashed nodes recover with all their data intact. It is not uncommon for replication algorithms in this space to depend on the existence of &ldquo;stable storage&rdquo; that cannot be lost in any failure-recovery scenario without potential consistency violations. There are two primary problems with this assumption. First, disk errors are the most common problem we observe in real operation of persistent data systems and they often do not leave data intact. Secondly, even if this were not a problem, we do not want to require the use of fsync on every write for our consistency guarantees as this can reduce performance by two to three orders of magnitude. Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed data in its crash.</p><h2 id=unclean-leader-election-what-if-they-all-die>Unclean leader election: What if they all die?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#unclean-leader-election-what-if-they-all-die aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Note that Kafka&rsquo;s guarantee with respect to data loss is predicated on at least one replica remaining in sync. If all the nodes replicating a partition die, this guarantee no longer holds.</p><p>However a practical system needs to do something reasonable when all the replicas die. If you are unlucky enough to have this occur, it is important to consider what will happen. There are two behaviors that could be implemented:</p><ol><li>Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data).</li><li>Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes back to life as the leader.</li></ol><p>This is a simple tradeoff between availability and consistency. If we wait for replicas in the ISR, then we will remain unavailable as long as those replicas are down. If such replicas were destroyed or their data was lost, then we are permanently down. If, on the other hand, a non-in-sync replica comes back to life and we allow it to become leader, then its log becomes the source of truth even though it is not guaranteed to have every committed message. By default, Kafka chooses the second strategy and favor choosing a potentially inconsistent replica when all replicas in the ISR are dead. This behavior can be disabled using configuration property unclean.leader.election.enable, to support use cases where downtime is preferable to inconsistency.</p><p>This dilemma is not specific to Kafka. It exists in any quorum-based scheme. For example in a majority voting scheme, if a majority of servers suffer a permanent failure, then you must either choose to lose 100% of your data or violate consistency by taking what remains on an existing server as your new source of truth.</p><h2 id=availability-and-durability-guarantees>Availability and Durability Guarantees<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#availability-and-durability-guarantees aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>When writing to Kafka, producers can choose whether they wait for the message to be acknowledged by 0,1 or all (-1) replicas. Note that &ldquo;acknowledgement by all replicas&rdquo; does not guarantee that the full set of assigned replicas have received the message. By default, when acks=all, acknowledgement happens as soon as all the current in-sync replicas have received the message. For example, if a topic is configured with only two replicas and one fails (i.e., only one in sync replica remains), then writes that specify acks=all will succeed. However, these writes could be lost if the remaining replica also fails. Although this ensures maximum availability of the partition, this behavior may be undesirable to some users who prefer durability over availability. Therefore, we provide two topic-level configurations that can be used to prefer message durability over availability:</p><ol><li>Disable unclean leader election - if all replicas become unavailable, then the partition will remain unavailable until the most recent leader becomes available again. This effectively prefers unavailability over the risk of message loss. See the previous section on Unclean Leader Election for clarification.</li><li>Specify a minimum ISR size - the partition will only accept writes if the size of the ISR is above a certain minimum, in order to prevent the loss of messages that were written to just a single replica, which subsequently becomes unavailable. This setting only takes effect if the producer uses acks=all and guarantees that the message will be acknowledged by at least this many in-sync replicas. This setting offers a trade-off between consistency and availability. A higher setting for minimum ISR size guarantees better consistency since the message is guaranteed to be written to more replicas which reduces the probability that it will be lost. However, it reduces availability since the partition will be unavailable for writes if the number of in-sync replicas drops below the minimum threshold.</li></ol><h2 id=replica-management>Replica Management<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#replica-management aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The above discussion on replicated logs really covers only a single log, i.e. one topic partition. However a Kafka cluster will manage hundreds or thousands of these partitions. We attempt to balance partitions within a cluster in a round-robin fashion to avoid clustering all partitions for high-volume topics on a small number of nodes. Likewise we try to balance leadership so that each node is the leader for a proportional share of its partitions.</p><p>It is also important to optimize the leadership election process as that is the critical window of unavailability. A naive implementation of leader election would end up running an election per partition for all partitions a node hosted when that node failed. Instead, we elect one of the brokers as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo;. This controller detects failures at the broker level and is responsible for changing the leader of all affected partitions in a failed broker. The result is that we are able to batch together many of the required leadership change notifications which makes the election process far cheaper and faster for a large number of partitions. If the controller fails, one of the surviving brokers will become the new controller.</p><h1 id=log-compaction>Log Compaction<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#log-compaction aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Log compaction ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the last known value for each message key within the log of data for a single topic partition. It addresses use cases and scenarios such as restoring state after application crashes or system failure, or reloading caches after application restarts during operational maintenance. Let&rsquo;s dive into these use cases in more detail and then describe how compaction works.</p><p>So far we have described only the simpler approach to data retention where old log data is discarded after a fixed period of time or when the log reaches some predetermined size. This works well for temporal event data such as logging where each record stands alone. However an important class of data streams are the log of changes to keyed, mutable data (for example, the changes to a database table).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s discuss a concrete example of such a stream. Say we have a topic containing user email addresses; every time a user updates their email address we send a message to this topic using their user id as the primary key. Now say we send the following messages over some time period for a user with id 123, each message corresponding to a change in email address (messages for other ids are omitted):</p><pre><code>        123 =&gt; bill@microsoft.com
                .
                .
                .
        123 =&gt; bill@gatesfoundation.org
                .
                .
                .
        123 =&gt; bill@gmail.com
</code></pre><p>Log compaction gives us a more granular retention mechanism so that we are guaranteed to retain at least the last update for each primary key (e.g. <code>bill@gmail.com</code>). By doing this we guarantee that the log contains a full snapshot of the final value for every key not just keys that changed recently. This means downstream consumers can restore their own state off this topic without us having to retain a complete log of all changes.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at a few use cases where this is useful, then we&rsquo;ll see how it can be used.</p><ol><li><em>Database change subscription</em>. It is often necessary to have a data set in multiple data systems, and often one of these systems is a database of some kind (either a RDBMS or perhaps a new-fangled key-value store). For example you might have a database, a cache, a search cluster, and a Hadoop cluster. Each change to the database will need to be reflected in the cache, the search cluster, and eventually in Hadoop. In the case that one is only handling the real-time updates you only need recent log. But if you want to be able to reload the cache or restore a failed search node you may need a complete data set.</li><li><em>Event sourcing</em>. This is a style of application design which co-locates query processing with application design and uses a log of changes as the primary store for the application.</li><li><em>Journaling for high-availability</em>. A process that does local computation can be made fault-tolerant by logging out changes that it makes to its local state so another process can reload these changes and carry on if it should fail. A concrete example of this is handling counts, aggregations, and other &ldquo;group by&rdquo;-like processing in a stream query system. Samza, a real-time stream-processing framework, <a href=http://samza.apache.org/learn/0.7.0/container/state-management.html>uses this feature</a> for exactly this purpose.
In each of these cases one needs primarily to handle the real-time feed of changes, but occasionally, when a machine crashes or data needs to be re-loaded or re-processed, one needs to do a full load. Log compaction allows feeding both of these use cases off the same backing topic. This style of usage of a log is described in more detail in <a href=http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying>this blog post</a>.</li></ol><p>The general idea is quite simple. If we had infinite log retention, and we logged each change in the above cases, then we would have captured the state of the system at each time from when it first began. Using this complete log, we could restore to any point in time by replaying the first N records in the log. This hypothetical complete log is not very practical for systems that update a single record many times as the log will grow without bound even for a stable dataset. The simple log retention mechanism which throws away old updates will bound space but the log is no longer a way to restore the current state&ndash;now restoring from the beginning of the log no longer recreates the current state as old updates may not be captured at all.</p><p>Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the same primary key. This way the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key.</p><p>This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics where retention is enforced by compaction.</p><p>This functionality is inspired by one of LinkedIn&rsquo;s oldest and most successful pieces of infrastructure&ndash;a database changelog caching service called <a href=https://github.com/linkedin/databus>Databus</a>. Unlike most log-structured storage systems Kafka is built for subscription and organizes data for fast linear reads and writes. Unlike Databus, Kafka acts as a source-of-truth store so it is useful even in situations where the upstream data source would not otherwise be replayable.</p><h2 id=log-compaction-basics>Log Compaction Basics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#log-compaction-basics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Here is a high-level picture that shows the logical structure of a Kafka log with the offset for each message.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/log_cleaner_anatomy.png></p><p>The head of the log is identical to a traditional Kafka log. It has dense, sequential offsets and retains all messages. Log compaction adds an option for handling the tail of the log. The picture above shows a log with a compacted tail. Note that the messages in the tail of the log retain the original offset assigned when they were first written&ndash;that never changes. Note also that all offsets remain valid positions in the log, even if the message with that offset has been compacted away; in this case this position is indistinguishable from the next highest offset that does appear in the log. For example, in the picture above the offsets 36, 37, and 38 are all equivalent positions and a read beginning at any of these offsets would return a message set beginning with 38.</p><p>Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null payload will be treated as a delete from the log. This delete marker will cause any prior message with that key to be removed (as would any new message with that key), but delete markers are special in that they will themselves be cleaned out of the log after a period of time to free up space. The point in time at which deletes are no longer retained is marked as the &ldquo;delete retention point&rdquo; in the above diagram.</p><p>The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log segments. Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting producers and consumers. The actual process of compacting a log segment looks something like this:</p><p><img src=/0110/images/log_compaction.png></p><h2 id=what-guarantees-does-log-compaction-provide>What guarantees does log compaction provide?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-guarantees-does-log-compaction-provide aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Log compaction guarantees the following:</p><ol><li>Any consumer that stays caught-up to within the head of the log will see every message that is written; these messages will have sequential offsets. The topic&rsquo;s <code>min.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to guarantee the minimum length of time must pass after a message is written before it could be compacted. I.e. it provides a lower bound on how long each message will remain in the (uncompacted) head.</li><li>Ordering of messages is always maintained. Compaction will never re-order messages, just remove some.</li><li>The offset for a message never changes. It is the permanent identifier for a position in the log.</li><li>Any consumer progressing from the start of the log will see at least the final state of all records in the order they were written. Additionally, all delete markers for deleted records will be seen, provided the consumer reaches the head of the log in a time period less than the topic&rsquo;s <code>delete.retention.ms</code> setting (the default is 24 hours). In other words: since the removal of delete markers happens concurrently with reads, it is possible for a consumer to miss delete markers if it lags by more than <code>delete.retention.ms</code>.</li></ol><h2 id=log-compaction-details>Log Compaction Details<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#log-compaction-details aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Log compaction is handled by the log cleaner, a pool of background threads that recopy log segment files, removing records whose key appears in the head of the log. Each compactor thread works as follows:</p><ol><li>It chooses the log that has the highest ratio of log head to log tail</li><li>It creates a succinct summary of the last offset for each key in the head of the log</li><li>It recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a later occurrence in the log. New, clean segments are swapped into the log immediately so the additional disk space required is just one additional log segment (not a fully copy of the log).</li><li>The summary of the log head is essentially just a space-compact hash table. It uses exactly 24 bytes per entry. As a result with 8GB of cleaner buffer one cleaner iteration can clean around 366GB of log head (assuming 1k messages).</li></ol><h2 id=configuring-the-log-cleaner>Configuring The Log Cleaner<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#configuring-the-log-cleaner aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The log cleaner is enabled by default. This will start the pool of cleaner threads. To enable log cleaning on a particular topic you can add the log-specific property</p><pre><code>  log.cleanup.policy=compact
</code></pre><p>This can be done either at topic creation time or using the alter topic command.</p><p>The log cleaner can be configured to retain a minimum amount of the uncompacted &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the log. This is enabled by setting the compaction time lag.</p><pre><code>  log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms
</code></pre><p>This can be used to prevent messages newer than a minimum message age from being subject to compaction. If not set, all log segments are eligible for compaction except for the last segment, i.e. the one currently being written to. The active segment will not be compacted even if all of its messages are older than the minimum compaction time lag.</p><p>Further cleaner configurations are described <a href=/documentation.html#brokerconfigs>here</a>.</p><h1 id=quotas>Quotas<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#quotas aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka cluster has the ability to enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources used by clients. Two types of client quotas can be enforced by Kafka brokers for each group of clients sharing a quota:</p><ol><li>Network bandwidth quotas define byte-rate thresholds (since 0.9)</li><li>Request rate quotas define CPU utilization thresholds as a percentage of network and I/O threads (since 0.11)</li></ol><h2 id=why-are-quotas-necessary>Why are quotas necessary?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#why-are-quotas-necessary aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>It is possible for producers and consumers to produce/consume very high volumes of data or generate requests at a very high rate and thus monopolize broker resources, cause network saturation and generally DOS other clients and the brokers themselves. Having quotas protects against these issues and is all the more important in large multi-tenant clusters where a small set of badly behaved clients can degrade user experience for the well behaved ones. In fact, when running Kafka as a service this even makes it possible to enforce API limits according to an agreed upon contract.</p><h2 id=client-groups>Client groups<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#client-groups aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The identity of Kafka clients is the user principal which represents an authenticated user in a secure cluster. In a cluster that supports unauthenticated clients, user principal is a grouping of unauthenticated users chosen by the broker using a configurable <code>PrincipalBuilder</code>. Client-id is a logical grouping of clients with a meaningful name chosen by the client application. The tuple (user, client-id) defines a secure logical group of clients that share both user principal and client-id.</p><p>Quotas can be applied to (user, client-id), user or client-id groups. For a given connection, the most specific quota matching the connection is applied. All connections of a quota group share the quota configured for the group. For example, if (user=&ldquo;test-user&rdquo;, client-id=&ldquo;test-client&rdquo;) has a produce quota of 10MB/sec, this is shared across all producer instances of user &ldquo;test-user&rdquo; with the client-id &ldquo;test-client&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=quota-configuration>Quota Configuration<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#quota-configuration aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Quota configuration may be defined for (user, client-id), user and client-id groups. It is possible to override the default quota at any of the quota levels that needs a higher (or even lower) quota. The mechanism is similar to the per-topic log config overrides. User and (user, client-id) quota overrides are written to ZooKeeper under <em><strong>/config/users</strong></em> and client-id quota overrides are written under <em><strong>/config/clients</strong></em>. These overrides are read by all brokers and are effective immediately. This lets us change quotas without having to do a rolling restart of the entire cluster. See here for details. Default quotas for each group may also be updated dynamically using the same mechanism.</p><p>The order of precedence for quota configuration is:</p><ol><li>/config/users/<user>/clients/<client-id></li><li>/config/users/<user>/clients/<default></li><li>/config/users/<user></li><li>/config/users/<default>/clients/<client-id></li><li>/config/users/<default>/clients/<default></li><li>/config/users/<default></li><li>/config/clients/<client-id></li><li>/config/clients/<default></li></ol><p>Broker properties (quota.producer.default, quota.consumer.default) can also be used to set defaults of network bandwidth quotas for client-id groups. These properties are being deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Default quotas for client-id can be set in Zookeeper similar to the other quota overrides and defaults.</p><h2 id=network-bandwidth-quotas>Network Bandwidth Quotas<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#network-bandwidth-quotas aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Network bandwidth quotas are defined as the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota. By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota in bytes/sec as configured by the cluster. This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each group of clients can publish/fetch a maximum of X bytes/sec per broker before clients are throttled.</p><h2 id=request-rate-quotas>Request Rate Quotas<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#request-rate-quotas aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Request rate quotas are defined as the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window. A quota of <code>n%</code> represents <code>n%</code> of one thread, so the quota is out of a total capacity of <code>((num.io.threads + num.network.threads) * 100)%</code>. Each group of clients may use a total percentage of upto <code>n%</code> across all I/O and network threads in a quota window before being throttled. Since the number of threads allocated for I/O and network threads are typically based on the number of cores available on the broker host, request rate quotas represent the total percentage of CPU that may be used by each group of clients sharing the quota.</p><h2 id=enforcement>Enforcement<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#enforcement aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota as configured by the cluster. This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each client can utilize this quota per broker before it gets throttled. We decided that defining these quotas per broker is much better than having a fixed cluster wide bandwidth per client because that would require a mechanism to share client quota usage among all the brokers. This can be harder to get right than the quota implementation itself!</p><p>How does a broker react when it detects a quota violation? In our solution, the broker does not return an error rather it attempts to slow down a client exceeding its quota. It computes the amount of delay needed to bring a guilty client under its quota and delays the response for that time. This approach keeps the quota violation transparent to clients (outside of client-side metrics). This also keeps them from having to implement any special backoff and retry behavior which can get tricky. In fact, bad client behavior (retry without backoff) can exacerbate the very problem quotas are trying to solve.</p><p>Byte-rate and thread utilization are measured over multiple small windows (e.g. 30 windows of 1 second each) in order to detect and correct quota violations quickly. Typically, having large measurement windows (for e.g. 10 windows of 30 seconds each) leads to large bursts of traffic followed by long delays which is not great in terms of user experience.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d8a7e11f739d5c0320928e90924afa7e>4.2 - Protocol</h1><h1 id=kafka-protocol-guide>Kafka protocol guide<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-protocol-guide aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>This document covers the wire protocol implemented in Kafka.

However it should not generally be necessary to maintain multiple connections to a single broker from a single client instance (i.e. connection pooling).</p><p>The server guarantees that on a single TCP connection, requests will be processed in the order they are sent and responses will return in that order as well. The broker&rsquo;s request processing allows only a single in-flight request per connection in order to guarantee this ordering. Note that clients can (and ideally should) use non-blocking IO to implement request pipelining and achieve higher throughput. i.e., clients can send requests even while awaiting responses for preceding requests since the outstanding requests will be buffered in the underlying OS socket buffer. All requests are initiated by the client, and result in a corresponding response message from the server except where noted.</p><p>The server has a configurable maximum limit on request size and any request that exceeds this limit will result in the socket being disconnected.</p><h3 id=partitioning-and-bootstrapping>Partitioning and bootstrapping<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#partitioning-and-bootstrapping aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Kafka is a partitioned system so not all servers have the complete data set. Instead recall that topics are split into a pre-defined number of partitions, P, and each partition is replicated with some replication factor, N. Topic partitions themselves are just ordered &ldquo;commit logs&rdquo; numbered 0, 1, &mldr;, P.</p><p>All systems of this nature have the question of how a particular piece of data is assigned to a particular partition. Kafka clients directly control this assignment, the brokers themselves enforce no particular semantics of which messages should be published to a particular partition. Rather, to publish messages the client directly addresses messages to a particular partition, and when fetching messages, fetches from a particular partition. If two clients want to use the same partitioning scheme they must use the same method to compute the mapping of key to partition.</p><p>These requests to publish or fetch data must be sent to the broker that is currently acting as the leader for a given partition. This condition is enforced by the broker, so a request for a particular partition to the wrong broker will result in an the NotLeaderForPartition error code (described below).</p><p>How can the client find out which topics exist, what partitions they have, and which brokers currently host those partitions so that it can direct its requests to the right hosts? This information is dynamic, so you can&rsquo;t just configure each client with some static mapping file. Instead all Kafka brokers can answer a metadata request that describes the current state of the cluster: what topics there are, which partitions those topics have, which broker is the leader for those partitions, and the host and port information for these brokers.</p><p>In other words, the client needs to somehow find one broker and that broker will tell the client about all the other brokers that exist and what partitions they host. This first broker may itself go down so the best practice for a client implementation is to take a list of two or three urls to bootstrap from. The user can then choose to use a load balancer or just statically configure two or three of their kafka hosts in the clients.</p><p>The client does not need to keep polling to see if the cluster has changed; it can fetch metadata once when it is instantiated cache that metadata until it receives an error indicating that the metadata is out of date. This error can come in two forms: (1) a socket error indicating the client cannot communicate with a particular broker, (2) an error code in the response to a request indicating that this broker no longer hosts the partition for which data was requested.</p><ol><li>Cycle through a list of &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; kafka urls until we find one we can connect to. Fetch cluster metadata.</li><li>Process fetch or produce requests, directing them to the appropriate broker based on the topic/partitions they send to or fetch from.</li><li>If we get an appropriate error, refresh the metadata and try again.</li></ol><h3 id=partitioning-strategies>Partitioning Strategies<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#partitioning-strategies aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>As mentioned above the assignment of messages to partitions is something the producing client controls. That said, how should this functionality be exposed to the end-user?</p><p>Partitioning really serves two purposes in Kafka:</p><ol><li>It balances data and request load over brokers</li><li>It serves as a way to divvy up processing among consumer processes while allowing local state and preserving order within the partition. We call this semantic partitioning.</li></ol><p>For a given use case you may care about only one of these or both.</p><p>To accomplish simple load balancing a simple approach would be for the client to just round robin requests over all brokers. Another alternative, in an environment where there are many more producers than brokers, would be to have each client chose a single partition at random and publish to that. This later strategy will result in far fewer TCP connections.</p><p>Semantic partitioning means using some key in the message to assign messages to partitions. For example if you were processing a click message stream you might want to partition the stream by the user id so that all data for a particular user would go to a single consumer. To accomplish this the client can take a key associated with the message and use some hash of this key to choose the partition to which to deliver the message.</p><h3 id=batching>Batching<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#batching aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Our apis encourage batching small things together for efficiency. We have found this is a very significant performance win. Both our API to send messages and our API to fetch messages always work with a sequence of messages not a single message to encourage this. A clever client can make use of this and support an &ldquo;asynchronous&rdquo; mode in which it batches together messages sent individually and sends them in larger clumps. We go even further with this and allow the batching across multiple topics and partitions, so a produce request may contain data to append to many partitions and a fetch request may pull data from many partitions all at once.</p><p>The client implementer can choose to ignore this and send everything one at a time if they like.</p><h3 id=versioning-and-compatibility>Versioning and Compatibility<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#versioning-and-compatibility aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The protocol is designed to enable incremental evolution in a backward compatible fashion. Our versioning is on a per API basis, each version consisting of a request and response pair. Each request contains an API key that identifies the API being invoked and a version number that indicates the format of the request and the expected format of the response.</p><p>The intention is that clients will support a range of API versions. When communicating with a particular broker, a given client should use the highest API version supported by both and indicate this version in their requests.</p><p>The server will reject requests with a version it does not support, and will always respond to the client with exactly the protocol format it expects based on the version it included in its request. The intended upgrade path is that new features would first be rolled out on the server (with the older clients not making use of them) and then as newer clients are deployed these new features would gradually be taken advantage of.</p><p>Our goal is primarily to allow API evolution in an environment where downtime is not allowed and clients and servers cannot all be changed at once.</p><p>Currently all versions are baselined at 0, as we evolve these APIs we will indicate the format for each version individually.</p><h3 id=retrieving-supported-api-versions>Retrieving Supported API versions<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#retrieving-supported-api-versions aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>In order to work against multiple broker versions, clients need to know what versions of various APIs a broker supports. The broker exposes this information since 0.10.0.0 as described in <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-35+-+Retrieving+protocol+version>KIP-35</a>. Clients should use the supported API versions information to choose the highest API version supported by both client and broker. If no such version exists, an error should be reported to the user.</p><p>The following sequence may be used by a client to obtain supported API versions from a broker.</p><ol><li>Client sends <code>ApiVersionsRequest</code> to a broker after connection has been established with the broker. If SSL is enabled, this happens after SSL connection has been established.</li><li>On receiving <code>ApiVersionsRequest</code>, a broker returns its full list of supported ApiKeys and versions regardless of current authentication state (e.g., before SASL authentication on an SASL listener, do note that no Kafka protocol requests may take place on a SSL listener before the SSL handshake is finished). If this is considered to leak information about the broker version a workaround is to use SSL with client authentication which is performed at an earlier stage of the connection where the <code>ApiVersionRequest</code> is not available. Also, note that broker versions older than 0.10.0.0 do not support this API and will either ignore the request or close connection in response to the request.</li><li>If multiple versions of an API are supported by broker and client, clients are recommended to use the latest version supported by the broker and itself.</li><li>Deprecation of a protocol version is done by marking an API version as deprecated in the protocol documentation.</li><li>Supported API versions obtained from a broker are only valid for the connection on which that information is obtained. In the event of disconnection, the client should obtain the information from the broker again, as the broker might have been upgraded/downgraded in the mean time.</li></ol><h3 id=sasl-authentication-sequence>SASL Authentication Sequence<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#sasl-authentication-sequence aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The following sequence is used for SASL authentication:</p><ol><li>Kafka <code>ApiVersionsRequest</code> may be sent by the client to obtain the version ranges of requests supported by the broker. This is optional.</li><li>Kafka <code>SaslHandshakeRequest</code> containing the SASL mechanism for authentication is sent by the client. If the requested mechanism is not enabled in the server, the server responds with the list of supported mechanisms and closes the client connection. If the mechanism is enabled in the server, the server sends a successful response and continues with SASL authentication.</li><li>The actual SASL authentication is now performed. A series of SASL client and server tokens corresponding to the mechanism are sent as opaque packets. These packets contain a 32-bit size followed by the token as defined by the protocol for the SASL mechanism.</li><li>If authentication succeeds, subsequent packets are handled as Kafka API requests. Otherwise, the client connection is closed.</li></ol><p>For interoperability with 0.9.0.x clients, the first packet received by the server is handled as a SASL/GSSAPI client token if it is not a valid Kafka request. SASL/GSSAPI authentication is performed starting with this packet, skipping the first two steps above.</p><h2 id=the-protocol>The Protocol<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-protocol aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><h3 id=protocol-primitive-types>Protocol Primitive Types<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#protocol-primitive-types aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The protocol is built out of the following primitive types.</p><p><strong>Fixed Width Primitives</strong></p><p>int8, int16, int32, int64 - Signed integers with the given precision (in bits) stored in big endian order.</p><p><strong>Variable Length Primitives</strong></p><p>bytes, string - These types consist of a signed integer giving a length N followed by N bytes of content.

There are a number of reasons, the best is that client implementors can make use of some of the more advanced TCP features&ndash;the ability to multiplex requests, the ability to simultaneously poll many connections, etc. We have also found HTTP libraries in many languages to be surprisingly shabby.</p><p>Others have asked if maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t support many different protocols. Prior experience with this was that it makes it very hard to add and test new features if they have to be ported across many protocol implementations. Our feeling is that most users don&rsquo;t really see multiple protocols as a feature, they just want a good reliable client in the language of their choice.</p><p>Another question is why we don&rsquo;t adopt XMPP, STOMP, AMQP or an existing protocol. The answer to this varies by protocol, but in general the problem is that the protocol does determine large parts of the implementation and we couldn&rsquo;t do what we are doing if we didn&rsquo;t have control over the protocol. Our belief is that it is possible to do better than existing messaging systems have in providing a truly distributed messaging system, and to do this we need to build something that works differently.</p><p>A final question is why we don&rsquo;t use a system like Protocol Buffers or Thrift to define our request messages. These packages excel at helping you to managing lots and lots of serialized messages. However we have only a few messages. Support across languages is somewhat spotty (depending on the package). Finally the mapping between binary log format and wire protocol is something we manage somewhat carefully and this would not be possible with these systems. Finally we prefer the style of versioning APIs explicitly and checking this to inferring new values as nulls as it allows more nuanced control of compatibility.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-1bc38883a1a50f6758304c7f95caa2ac>5 - Implementation</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-e2857793252a711b0e90786d57a0c2c1>5.1 - Network Layer</h1><div class=lead>Network Layer</div><h1 id=network-layer>Network Layer<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#network-layer aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>The network layer is a fairly straight-forward NIO server, and will not be described in great detail. The sendfile implementation is done by giving the <code>MessageSet</code> interface a <code>writeTo</code> method. This allows the file-backed message set to use the more efficient <code>transferTo</code> implementation instead of an in-process buffered write. The threading model is a single acceptor thread and <em>N</em> processor threads which handle a fixed number of connections each. This design has been pretty thoroughly tested <a href=http://sna-projects.com/blog/2009/08/introducing-the-nio-socketserver-implementation>elsewhere</a> and found to be simple to implement and fast.

The format of the header is described in the following section. Leaving the key and value opaque is the right decision: there is a great deal of progress being made on serialization libraries right now, and any particular choice is unlikely to be right for all uses. Needless to say a particular application using Kafka would likely mandate a particular serialization type as part of its usage. The <code>RecordBatch</code> interface is simply an iterator over messages with specialized methods for bulk reading and writing to an NIO <code>Channel</code>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-c460adae3effd4105f783c45dc4a4327>5.3 - Message Format</h1><div class=lead>Message Format</div><h1 id=message-format>Message Format<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#message-format aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Messages (aka Records) are always written in batches. The technical term for a batch of messages is a record batch, and a record batch contains one or more records. In the degenerate case, we could have a record batch containing a single record. Record batches and records have their own headers. The format of each is described below for Kafka version 0.11.0 and later (message format version v2, or magic=2). <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/A+Guide+To+The+Kafka+Protocol#AGuideToTheKafkaProtocol-Messagesets>Click here</a> for details about message formats 0 and 1.</p><h2 id=record-batch>Record Batch<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#record-batch aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The following is the on-disk format of a RecordBatch.</p><pre><code>		baseOffset: int64
		batchLength: int32
		partitionLeaderEpoch: int32
		magic: int8 (current magic value is 2)
		crc: int32
		attributes: int16
			bit 0~2:
				0: no compression
				1: gzip
				2: snappy
				3: lz4
			bit 3: timestampType

		lastOffsetDelta: int32
		firstTimestamp: int64
		maxTimestamp: int64
		producerId: int64
		producerEpoch: int16
		baseSequence: int32
		records: [Record]
</code></pre><p>Note that when compression is enabled, the compressed record data is serialized directly following the count of the number of records.</p><p>The CRC covers the data from the attributes to the end of the batch (i.e. all the bytes that follow the CRC). It is located after the magic byte, which means that clients must parse the magic byte before deciding how to interpret the bytes between the batch length and the magic byte. The partition leader epoch field is not included in the CRC computation to avoid the need to recompute the CRC when this field is assigned for every batch that is received by the broker. The CRC-32C (Castagnoli) polynomial is used for the computation.</p><p>On compaction: unlike the older message formats, magic v2 and above preserves the first and last offset/sequence numbers from the original batch when the log is cleaned. This is required in order to be able to restore the producer&rsquo;s state when the log is reloaded. If we did not retain the last sequence number, for example, then after a partition leader failure, the producer might see an OutOfSequence error. The base sequence number must be preserved for duplicate checking (the broker checks incoming Produce requests for duplicates by verifying that the first and last sequence numbers of the incoming batch match the last from that producer). As a result, it is possible to have empty batches in the log when all the records in the batch are cleaned but batch is still retained in order to preserve a producer&rsquo;s last sequence number. One oddity here is that the baseTimestamp field is not preserved during compaction, so it will change if the first record in the batch is compacted away.</p><h3 id=control-batches>Control Batches<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#control-batches aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>A control batch contains a single record called the control record. Control records should not be passed on to applications. Instead, they are used by consumers to filter out aborted transactional messages.</p><p>The key of a control record conforms to the following schema:</p><pre><code>       version: int16 (current version is 0)
       type: int16 (0 indicates an abort marker, 1 indicates a commit)
</code></pre><p>The schema for the value of a control record is dependent on the type. The value is opaque to clients.</p><h2 id=record>Record<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#record aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Record level headers were introduced in Kafka 0.11.0.

The format of the log files is a sequence of &ldquo;log entries&rdquo;"; each log entry is a 4 byte integer <em>N</em> storing the message length which is followed by the <em>N</em> message bytes. Each message is uniquely identified by a 64-bit integer <em>offset</em> giving the byte position of the start of this message in the stream of all messages ever sent to that topic on that partition. The on-disk format of each message is given below. Each log file is named with the offset of the first message it contains. So the first file created will be 00000000000.kafka, and each additional file will have an integer name roughly <em>S</em> bytes from the previous file where <em>S</em> is the max log file size given in the configuration.</p><p>The exact binary format for records is versioned and maintained as a standard interface so record batches can be transferred between producer, broker, and client without recopying or conversion when desirable. The previous section included details about the on-disk format of records.</p><p>The use of the message offset as the message id is unusual. Our original idea was to use a GUID generated by the producer, and maintain a mapping from GUID to offset on each broker. But since a consumer must maintain an ID for each server, the global uniqueness of the GUID provides no value. Furthermore, the complexity of maintaining the mapping from a random id to an offset requires a heavy weight index structure which must be synchronized with disk, essentially requiring a full persistent random-access data structure. Thus to simplify the lookup structure we decided to use a simple per-partition atomic counter which could be coupled with the partition id and node id to uniquely identify a message; this makes the lookup structure simpler, though multiple seeks per consumer request are still likely. However once we settled on a counter, the jump to directly using the offset seemed natural&ndash;both after all are monotonically increasing integers unique to a partition. Since the offset is hidden from the consumer API this decision is ultimately an implementation detail and we went with the more efficient approach.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/kafka_log.png></p><h2 id=writes>Writes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#writes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The log allows serial appends which always go to the last file. This file is rolled over to a fresh file when it reaches a configurable size (say 1GB). The log takes two configuration parameters: <em>M</em> , which gives the number of messages to write before forcing the OS to flush the file to disk, and <em>S</em> , which gives a number of seconds after which a flush is forced. This gives a durability guarantee of losing at most <em>M</em> messages or <em>S</em> seconds of data in the event of a system crash.</p><h2 id=reads>Reads<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#reads aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Reads are done by giving the 64-bit logical offset of a message and an <em>S</em> -byte max chunk size. This will return an iterator over the messages contained in the <em>S</em> -byte buffer. <em>S</em> is intended to be larger than any single message, but in the event of an abnormally large message, the read can be retried multiple times, each time doubling the buffer size, until the message is read successfully. A maximum message and buffer size can be specified to make the server reject messages larger than some size, and to give a bound to the client on the maximum it needs to ever read to get a complete message. It is likely that the read buffer ends with a partial message, this is easily detected by the size delimiting.</p><p>The actual process of reading from an offset requires first locating the log segment file in which the data is stored, calculating the file-specific offset from the global offset value, and then reading from that file offset. The search is done as a simple binary search variation against an in-memory range maintained for each file.</p><p>The log provides the capability of getting the most recently written message to allow clients to start subscribing as of &ldquo;right now&rdquo;. This is also useful in the case the consumer fails to consume its data within its SLA-specified number of days. In this case when the client attempts to consume a non-existent offset it is given an OutOfRangeException and can either reset itself or fail as appropriate to the use case.</p><p>The following is the format of the results sent to the consumer.</p><pre><code>    MessageSetSend (fetch result)

    total length     : 4 bytes
    error code       : 2 bytes
    message 1        : x bytes
    ...
    message n        : x bytes
    


    MultiMessageSetSend (multiFetch result)

    error code         : 2 bytes
    messageSetSend 1
    ...
    messageSetSend n
</code></pre><h2 id=deletes>Deletes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#deletes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Data is deleted one log segment at a time. The log manager allows pluggable delete policies to choose which files are eligible for deletion. The current policy deletes any log with a modification time of more than <em>N</em> days ago, though a policy which retained the last <em>N</em> GB could also be useful. To avoid locking reads while still allowing deletes that modify the segment list we use a copy-on-write style segment list implementation that provides consistent views to allow a binary search to proceed on an immutable static snapshot view of the log segments while deletes are progressing.</p><h2 id=guarantees>Guarantees<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#guarantees aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The log provides a configuration parameter <em>M</em> which controls the maximum number of messages that are written before forcing a flush to disk. On startup a log recovery process is run that iterates over all messages in the newest log segment and verifies that each message entry is valid. A message entry is valid if the sum of its size and offset are less than the length of the file AND the CRC32 of the message payload matches the CRC stored with the message. In the event corruption is detected the log is truncated to the last valid offset.</p><p>Note that two kinds of corruption must be handled: truncation in which an unwritten block is lost due to a crash, and corruption in which a nonsense block is ADDED to the file. The reason for this is that in general the OS makes no guarantee of the write order between the file inode and the actual block data so in addition to losing written data the file can gain nonsense data if the inode is updated with a new size but a crash occurs before the block containing that data is written. The CRC detects this corner case, and prevents it from corrupting the log (though the unwritten messages are, of course, lost).</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-b0869d22271b994edbd4e76bac501e79>5.5 - Distribution</h1><div class=lead>Distribution</div><h1 id=distribution>Distribution<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#distribution aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=consumer-offset-tracking>Consumer Offset Tracking<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#consumer-offset-tracking aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The high-level consumer tracks the maximum offset it has consumed in each partition and periodically commits its offset vector so that it can resume from those offsets in the event of a restart. Kafka provides the option to store all the offsets for a given consumer group in a designated broker (for that group) called the <em>offset manager</em>. i.e., any consumer instance in that consumer group should send its offset commits and fetches to that offset manager (broker). The high-level consumer handles this automatically. If you use the simple consumer you will need to manage offsets manually. This is currently unsupported in the Java simple consumer which can only commit or fetch offsets in ZooKeeper. If you use the Scala simple consumer you can discover the offset manager and explicitly commit or fetch offsets to the offset manager. A consumer can look up its offset manager by issuing a GroupCoordinatorRequest to any Kafka broker and reading the GroupCoordinatorResponse which will contain the offset manager. The consumer can then proceed to commit or fetch offsets from the offsets manager broker. In case the offset manager moves, the consumer will need to rediscover the offset manager. If you wish to manage your offsets manually, you can take a look at these <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Committing+and+fetching+consumer+offsets+in+Kafka>code samples that explain how to issue OffsetCommitRequest and OffsetFetchRequest</a>.</p><p>When the offset manager receives an OffsetCommitRequest, it appends the request to a special compacted Kafka topic named __<em>consumer_offsets</em>. The offset manager sends a successful offset commit response to the consumer only after all the replicas of the offsets topic receive the offsets. In case the offsets fail to replicate within a configurable timeout, the offset commit will fail and the consumer may retry the commit after backing off. (This is done automatically by the high-level consumer.) The brokers periodically compact the offsets topic since it only needs to maintain the most recent offset commit per partition. The offset manager also caches the offsets in an in-memory table in order to serve offset fetches quickly.</p><p>When the offset manager receives an offset fetch request, it simply returns the last committed offset vector from the offsets cache. In case the offset manager was just started or if it just became the offset manager for a new set of consumer groups (by becoming a leader for a partition of the offsets topic), it may need to load the offsets topic partition into the cache. In this case, the offset fetch will fail with an OffsetsLoadInProgress exception and the consumer may retry the OffsetFetchRequest after backing off. (This is done automatically by the high-level consumer.)</p><h3 id=migrating-offsets-from-zookeeper-to-kafka>Migrating offsets from ZooKeeper to Kafka<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#migrating-offsets-from-zookeeper-to-kafka aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Kafka consumers in earlier releases store their offsets by default in ZooKeeper.

For example /topics/[topic] would be a directory named /topics containing a sub-directory for each topic name. Numerical ranges are also given such as [0&mldr;5] to indicate the subdirectories 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. An arrow -> is used to indicate the contents of a znode. For example /hello -> world would indicate a znode /hello containing the value &ldquo;world&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=broker-node-registry>Broker Node Registry<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#broker-node-registry aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><pre><code>    /brokers/ids/[0...N] --&gt; {&quot;jmx_port&quot;:...,&quot;timestamp&quot;:...,&quot;endpoints&quot;:[...],&quot;host&quot;:...,&quot;version&quot;:...,&quot;port&quot;:...} (ephemeral node)
</code></pre><p>This is a list of all present broker nodes, each of which provides a unique logical broker id which identifies it to consumers (which must be given as part of its configuration). On startup, a broker node registers itself by creating a znode with the logical broker id under /brokers/ids. The purpose of the logical broker id is to allow a broker to be moved to a different physical machine without affecting consumers. An attempt to register a broker id that is already in use (say because two servers are configured with the same broker id) results in an error.</p><p>Since the broker registers itself in ZooKeeper using ephemeral znodes, this registration is dynamic and will disappear if the broker is shutdown or dies (thus notifying consumers it is no longer available).</p><h2 id=broker-topic-registry>Broker Topic Registry<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#broker-topic-registry aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><pre><code>    /brokers/topics/[topic]/partitions/[0...N]/state --&gt; {&quot;controller_epoch&quot;:...,&quot;leader&quot;:...,&quot;version&quot;:...,&quot;leader_epoch&quot;:...,&quot;isr&quot;:[...]} (ephemeral node)

Therefore, it is recommended to migrate offsets storage to Kafka.</p><p>Multiple consumers can form a group and jointly consume a single topic. Each consumer in the same group is given a shared group_id. For example if one consumer is your foobar process, which is run across three machines, then you might assign this group of consumers the id &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;.

Conceptually, it is auto-generated when a cluster is started for the first time.</p><p>Implementation-wise, it is generated when a broker with version 0.10.1 or later is successfully started for the first time.

Consumer rebalancing is triggered on each addition or removal of both broker nodes and other consumers within the same group. For a given topic and a given consumer group, broker partitions are divided evenly among consumers within the group. A partition is always consumed by a single consumer. This design simplifies the implementation. Had we allowed a partition to be concurrently consumed by multiple consumers, there would be contention on the partition and some kind of locking would be required. If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers won&rsquo;t get any data at all. During rebalancing, we try to assign partitions to consumers in such a way that reduces the number of broker nodes each consumer has to connect to.</p><p>Each consumer does the following during rebalancing:</p><pre><code>    1. For each topic T that Ci subscribes to
    2.   let PT be all partitions producing topic T
    3.   let CG be all consumers in the same group as Ci that consume topic T
    4.   sort PT (so partitions on the same broker are clustered together)
    5.   sort CG
    6.   let i be the index position of Ci in CG and let N = size(PT)/size(CG)
    7.   assign partitions from i*N to (i+1)*N - 1 to consumer Ci
    8.   remove current entries owned by Ci from the partition owner registry
    9.   add newly assigned partitions to the partition owner registry
            (we may need to re-try this until the original partition owner releases its ownership)
</code></pre><p>When rebalancing is triggered at one consumer, rebalancing should be triggered in other consumers within the same group about the same time.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8c6f7785f3a564a3c76d4c3491f9b27e>6 - Operations</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-98d71cc3b76d01d7a878fb58537edac0>6.1 - Basic Kafka Operations</h1><div class=lead>Basic Kafka Operations</div><h1 id=basic-kafka-operations>Basic Kafka Operations<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#basic-kafka-operations aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>This section will review the most common operations you will perform on your Kafka cluster. All of the tools reviewed in this section are available under the <code>bin/</code> directory of the Kafka distribution and each tool will print details on all possible commandline options if it is run with no arguments.</p><h2 id=adding-and-removing-topics>Adding and removing topics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#adding-and-removing-topics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You have the option of either adding topics manually or having them be created automatically when data is first published to a non-existent topic. If topics are auto-created then you may want to tune the default topic configurations used for auto-created topics.</p><p>Topics are added and modified using the topic tool:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot --create --topic my_topic_name
        --partitions 20 --replication-factor 3 --config x=y
</code></pre><p>The replication factor controls how many servers will replicate each message that is written. If you have a replication factor of 3 then up to 2 servers can fail before you will lose access to your data. We recommend you use a replication factor of 2 or 3 so that you can transparently bounce machines without interrupting data consumption.</p><p>The partition count controls how many logs the topic will be sharded into. There are several impacts of the partition count. First each partition must fit entirely on a single server. So if you have 20 partitions the full data set (and read and write load) will be handled by no more than 20 servers (not counting replicas). Finally the partition count impacts the maximum parallelism of your consumers. This is discussed in greater detail in the concepts section.</p><p>Each sharded partition log is placed into its own folder under the Kafka log directory. The name of such folders consists of the topic name, appended by a dash (-) and the partition id. Since a typical folder name can not be over 255 characters long, there will be a limitation on the length of topic names. We assume the number of partitions will not ever be above 100,000. Therefore, topic names cannot be longer than 249 characters. This leaves just enough room in the folder name for a dash and a potentially 5 digit long partition id.</p><p>The configurations added on the command line override the default settings the server has for things like the length of time data should be retained. The complete set of per-topic configurations is documented here.</p><h2 id=modifying-topics>Modifying topics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#modifying-topics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You can change the configuration or partitioning of a topic using the same topic tool.</p><p>To add partitions you can do</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot --alter --topic my_topic_name
        --partitions 40
</code></pre><p>Be aware that one use case for partitions is to semantically partition data, and adding partitions doesn&rsquo;t change the partitioning of existing data so this may disturb consumers if they rely on that partition. That is if data is partitioned by <code>hash(key) % number_of_partitions</code> then this partitioning will potentially be shuffled by adding partitions but Kafka will not attempt to automatically redistribute data in any way.</p><p>To add configs:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot --entity-type topics --entity-name my_topic_name --alter --add-config x=y
</code></pre><p>To remove a config:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot --entity-type topics --entity-name my_topic_name --alter --delete-config x
</code></pre><p>And finally deleting a topic:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot --delete --topic my_topic_name
</code></pre><p>Topic deletion option is disabled by default. To enable it set the server config</p><pre><code>delete.topic.enable=true
</code></pre><p>Kafka does not currently support reducing the number of partitions for a topic.</p><p>Instructions for changing the replication factor of a topic can be found here.</p><h2 id=graceful-shutdown>Graceful shutdown<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#graceful-shutdown aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The Kafka cluster will automatically detect any broker shutdown or failure and elect new leaders for the partitions on that machine. This will occur whether a server fails or it is brought down intentionally for maintenance or configuration changes. For the latter cases Kafka supports a more graceful mechanism for stopping a server than just killing it. When a server is stopped gracefully it has two optimizations it will take advantage of:</p><ol><li><p>It will sync all its logs to disk to avoid needing to do any log recovery when it restarts (i.e. validating the checksum for all messages in the tail of the log). Log recovery takes time so this speeds up intentional restarts.</p></li><li><p>It will migrate any partitions the server is the leader for to other replicas prior to shutting down. This will make the leadership transfer faster and minimize the time each partition is unavailable to a few milliseconds.
Syncing the logs will happen automatically whenever the server is stopped other than by a hard kill, but the controlled leadership migration requires using a special setting:</p><pre><code> controlled.shutdown.enable=true
</code></pre></li></ol><p>Note that controlled shutdown will only succeed if <em>all</em> the partitions hosted on the broker have replicas (i.e. the replication factor is greater than 1 <em>and</em> at least one of these replicas is alive). This is generally what you want since shutting down the last replica would make that topic partition unavailable.</p><h2 id=balancing-leadership>Balancing leadership<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#balancing-leadership aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Whenever a broker stops or crashes leadership for that broker&rsquo;s partitions transfers to other replicas. This means that by default when the broker is restarted it will only be a follower for all its partitions, meaning it will not be used for client reads and writes.</p><p>To avoid this imbalance, Kafka has a notion of preferred replicas. If the list of replicas for a partition is 1,5,9 then node 1 is preferred as the leader to either node 5 or 9 because it is earlier in the replica list. You can have the Kafka cluster try to restore leadership to the restored replicas by running the command:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-preferred-replica-election.sh --zookeeper zk_host:port/chroot
</code></pre><p>Since running this command can be tedious you can also configure Kafka to do this automatically by setting the following configuration:</p><pre><code>      auto.leader.rebalance.enable=true
</code></pre><h2 id=balancing-replicas-across-racks>Balancing Replicas Across Racks<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#balancing-replicas-across-racks aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The rack awareness feature spreads replicas of the same partition across different racks. This extends the guarantees Kafka provides for broker-failure to cover rack-failure, limiting the risk of data loss should all the brokers on a rack fail at once. The feature can also be applied to other broker groupings such as availability zones in EC2.</p><p>You can specify that a broker belongs to a particular rack by adding a property to the broker config:</p><pre><code>   broker.rack=my-rack-id
</code></pre><p>When a topic is created, modified or replicas are redistributed, the rack constraint will be honoured, ensuring replicas span as many racks as they can (a partition will span min(#racks, replication-factor) different racks).</p><p>The algorithm used to assign replicas to brokers ensures that the number of leaders per broker will be constant, regardless of how brokers are distributed across racks. This ensures balanced throughput.</p><p>However if racks are assigned different numbers of brokers, the assignment of replicas will not be even. Racks with fewer brokers will get more replicas, meaning they will use more storage and put more resources into replication. Hence it is sensible to configure an equal number of brokers per rack.</p><h2 id=mirroring-data-between-clusters>Mirroring data between clusters<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#mirroring-data-between-clusters aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>We refer to the process of replicating data <em>between</em> Kafka clusters &ldquo;mirroring&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the replication that happens amongst the nodes in a single cluster. Kafka comes with a tool for mirroring data between Kafka clusters. The tool consumes from a source cluster and produces to a destination cluster. A common use case for this kind of mirroring is to provide a replica in another datacenter. This scenario will be discussed in more detail in the next section.</p><p>You can run many such mirroring processes to increase throughput and for fault-tolerance (if one process dies, the others will take overs the additional load).</p><p>Data will be read from topics in the source cluster and written to a topic with the same name in the destination cluster. In fact the mirror maker is little more than a Kafka consumer and producer hooked together.</p><p>The source and destination clusters are completely independent entities: they can have different numbers of partitions and the offsets will not be the same. For this reason the mirror cluster is not really intended as a fault-tolerance mechanism (as the consumer position will be different); for that we recommend using normal in-cluster replication. The mirror maker process will, however, retain and use the message key for partitioning so order is preserved on a per-key basis.</p><p>Here is an example showing how to mirror a single topic (named <em>my-topic</em>) from an input cluster:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-mirror-maker.sh
        --consumer.config consumer.properties
        --producer.config producer.properties --whitelist my-topic
</code></pre><p>Note that we specify the list of topics with the <code>--whitelist</code> option. This option allows any regular expression using <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html>Java-style regular expressions</a>. So you could mirror two topics named <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> using <code>--whitelist 'A|B'</code>. Or you could mirror <em>all</em> topics using <code>--whitelist '*'</code>. Make sure to quote any regular expression to ensure the shell doesn&rsquo;t try to expand it as a file path. For convenience we allow the use of &lsquo;,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;|&rsquo; to specify a list of topics.</p><p>Sometimes it is easier to say what it is that you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want. Instead of using <code>--whitelist</code> to say what you want to mirror you can use <code>--blacklist</code> to say what to exclude. This also takes a regular expression argument. However, <code>--blacklist</code> is not supported when the new consumer has been enabled (i.e. when <code>bootstrap.servers</code> has been defined in the consumer configuration).</p><p>Combining mirroring with the configuration <code>auto.create.topics.enable=true</code> makes it possible to have a replica cluster that will automatically create and replicate all data in a source cluster even as new topics are added.</p><h2 id=checking-consumer-position>Checking consumer position<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#checking-consumer-position aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to see the position of your consumers. We have a tool that will show the position of all consumers in a consumer group as well as how far behind the end of the log they are. To run this tool on a consumer group named <em>my-group</em> consuming a topic named <em>my-topic</em> would look like this:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.ConsumerOffsetChecker --zookeeper localhost:2181 --group test
  Group           Topic                          Pid Offset          logSize         Lag             Owner
  my-group        my-topic                       0   0               0               0               test_jkreps-mn-1394154511599-60744496-0
  my-group        my-topic                       1   0               0               0               test_jkreps-mn-1394154521217-1a0be913-0
</code></pre><p>NOTE: Since 0.9.0.0, the kafka.tools.ConsumerOffsetChecker tool has been deprecated. You should use the kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand (or the bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh script) to manage consumer groups, including consumers created with the <a href=http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newconsumerapi>new consumer API</a>.</p><h2 id=managing-consumer-groups>Managing Consumer Groups<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#managing-consumer-groups aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>With the ConsumerGroupCommand tool, we can list, describe, or delete consumer groups. Note that deletion is only available when the group metadata is stored in ZooKeeper. When using the <a href=http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newconsumerapi>new consumer API</a> (where the broker handles coordination of partition handling and rebalance), the group is deleted when the last committed offset for that group expires. For example, to list all consumer groups across all topics:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server broker1:9092 --list

  test-consumer-group
</code></pre><p>To view offsets as in the previous example with the ConsumerOffsetChecker, we &ldquo;describe&rdquo; the consumer group like this:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server broker1:9092 --describe --group test-consumer-group

  TOPIC                          PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG        CONSUMER-ID                                       HOST                           CLIENT-ID
  test-foo                       0          1               3               2          consumer-1-a5d61779-4d04-4c50-a6d6-fb35d942642d   /127.0.0.1                     consumer-1
</code></pre><p>If you are using the old high-level consumer and storing the group metadata in ZooKeeper (i.e. <code>offsets.storage=zookeeper</code>), pass <code>--zookeeper</code> instead of <code>bootstrap-server</code>:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list
</code></pre><h2 id=expanding-your-cluster>Expanding your cluster<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#expanding-your-cluster aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Adding servers to a Kafka cluster is easy, just assign them a unique broker id and start up Kafka on your new servers. However these new servers will not automatically be assigned any data partitions, so unless partitions are moved to them they won&rsquo;t be doing any work until new topics are created. So usually when you add machines to your cluster you will want to migrate some existing data to these machines.</p><p>The process of migrating data is manually initiated but fully automated. Under the covers what happens is that Kafka will add the new server as a follower of the partition it is migrating and allow it to fully replicate the existing data in that partition. When the new server has fully replicated the contents of this partition and joined the in-sync replica one of the existing replicas will delete their partition&rsquo;s data.</p><p>The partition reassignment tool can be used to move partitions across brokers. An ideal partition distribution would ensure even data load and partition sizes across all brokers. The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around.</p><p>The partition reassignment tool can run in 3 mutually exclusive modes:</p><ul><li>--generate: In this mode, given a list of topics and a list of brokers, the tool generates a candidate reassignment to move all partitions of the specified topics to the new brokers. This option merely provides a convenient way to generate a partition reassignment plan given a list of topics and target brokers.</li><li>--execute: In this mode, the tool kicks off the reassignment of partitions based on the user provided reassignment plan. (using the &ndash;reassignment-json-file option). This can either be a custom reassignment plan hand crafted by the admin or provided by using the &ndash;generate option</li><li>--verify: In this mode, the tool verifies the status of the reassignment for all partitions listed during the last &ndash;execute. The status can be either of successfully completed, failed or in progress</li></ul><h3 id=automatically-migrating-data-to-new-machines>Automatically migrating data to new machines<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#automatically-migrating-data-to-new-machines aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The partition reassignment tool can be used to move some topics off of the current set of brokers to the newly added brokers. This is typically useful while expanding an existing cluster since it is easier to move entire topics to the new set of brokers, than moving one partition at a time. When used to do this, the user should provide a list of topics that should be moved to the new set of brokers and a target list of new brokers. The tool then evenly distributes all partitions for the given list of topics across the new set of brokers. During this move, the replication factor of the topic is kept constant. Effectively the replicas for all partitions for the input list of topics are moved from the old set of brokers to the newly added brokers.</p><p>For instance, the following example will move all partitions for topics foo1,foo2 to the new set of brokers 5,6. At the end of this move, all partitions for topics foo1 and foo2 will <em>only</em> exist on brokers 5,6.</p><p>Since the tool accepts the input list of topics as a json file, you first need to identify the topics you want to move and create the json file as follows:</p><pre><code>  &gt; cat topics-to-move.json
  {&quot;topics&quot;: [{&quot;topic&quot;: &quot;foo1&quot;},
              {&quot;topic&quot;: &quot;foo2&quot;}],
  &quot;version&quot;:1
  }
</code></pre><p>Once the json file is ready, use the partition reassignment tool to generate a candidate assignment:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topics-to-move-json-file topics-to-move.json --broker-list &quot;5,6&quot; --generate

To make this process effortless, we plan to add tooling support for decommissioning brokers in the future.</p><h2 id=increasing-replication-factor>Increasing replication factor<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#increasing-replication-factor aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Increasing the replication factor of an existing partition is easy. Just specify the extra replicas in the custom reassignment json file and use it with the &ndash;execute option to increase the replication factor of the specified partitions.</p><p>For instance, the following example increases the replication factor of partition 0 of topic foo from 1 to 3. Before increasing the replication factor, the partition&rsquo;s only replica existed on broker 5. As part of increasing the replication factor, we will add more replicas on brokers 6 and 7.</p><p>The first step is to hand craft the custom reassignment plan in a json file:</p><pre><code>  &gt; cat increase-replication-factor.json
  {&quot;version&quot;:1,
  &quot;partitions&quot;:[{&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:0,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6,7]}]}
</code></pre><p>Then, use the json file with the &ndash;execute option to start the reassignment process:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --reassignment-json-file increase-replication-factor.json --execute
  Current partition replica assignment

  {&quot;version&quot;:1,
  &quot;partitions&quot;:[{&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:0,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5]}]}

  Save this to use as the --reassignment-json-file option during rollback
  Successfully started reassignment of partitions
  {&quot;version&quot;:1,
  &quot;partitions&quot;:[{&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:0,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6,7]}]}
</code></pre><p>The &ndash;verify option can be used with the tool to check the status of the partition reassignment. Note that the same increase-replication-factor.json (used with the &ndash;execute option) should be used with the &ndash;verify option:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --reassignment-json-file increase-replication-factor.json --verify
  Status of partition reassignment:
  Reassignment of partition [foo,0] completed successfully
</code></pre><p>You can also verify the increase in replication factor with the kafka-topics tool:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic foo --describe
  Topic:foo	PartitionCount:1	ReplicationFactor:3	Configs:
    Topic: foo	Partition: 0	Leader: 5	Replicas: 5,6,7	Isr: 5,6,7

This is useful when rebalancing a cluster, bootstrapping a new broker or adding or removing brokers, as it limits the impact these data-intensive operations will have on users.</p><p>There are two interfaces that can be used to engage a throttle. The simplest, and safest, is to apply a throttle when invoking the kafka-reassign-partitions.sh, but kafka-configs.sh can also be used to view and alter the throttle values directly.</p><p>So for example, if you were to execute a rebalance, with the below command, it would move partitions at no more than 50MB/s.</p><pre><code>$ bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper myhost:2181--execute --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json —throttle 50000000
</code></pre><p>When you execute this script you will see the throttle engage:</p><pre><code>  The throttle limit was set to 50000000 B/s
  Successfully started reassignment of partitions.
</code></pre><p>Should you wish to alter the throttle, during a rebalance, say to increase the throughput so it completes quicker, you can do this by re-running the execute command passing the same reassignment-json-file:</p><pre><code>$ bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181  --execute --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json --throttle 700000000
  There is an existing assignment running.
  The throttle limit was set to 700000000 B/s
</code></pre><p>Once the rebalance completes the administrator can check the status of the rebalance using the &ndash;verify option. If the rebalance has completed, the throttle will be removed via the &ndash;verify command. It is important that administrators remove the throttle in a timely manner once rebalancing completes by running the command with the &ndash;verify option. Failure to do so could cause regular replication traffic to be throttled.</p><p>When the &ndash;verify option is executed, and the reassignment has completed, the script will confirm that the throttle was removed:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181  --verify --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json
  Status of partition reassignment:
  Reassignment of partition [my-topic,1] completed successfully
  Reassignment of partition [mytopic,0] completed successfully
  Throttle was removed.
</code></pre><p>The administrator can also validate the assigned configs using the kafka-configs.sh. There are two pairs of throttle configuration used to manage the throttling process. The throttle value itself. This is configured, at a broker level, using the dynamic properties:</p><pre><code>leader.replication.throttled.rate
  follower.replication.throttled.rate
</code></pre><p>There is also an enumerated set of throttled replicas:</p><pre><code>leader.replication.throttled.replicas
  follower.replication.throttled.replicas
</code></pre><p>Which are configured per topic. All four config values are automatically assigned by kafka-reassign-partitions.sh (discussed below).</p><p>To view the throttle limit configuration:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type brokers
  Configs for brokers '2' are leader.replication.throttled.rate=700000000,follower.replication.throttled.rate=700000000
  Configs for brokers '1' are leader.replication.throttled.rate=700000000,follower.replication.throttled.rate=700000000
</code></pre><p>This shows the throttle applied to both leader and follower side of the replication protocol. By default both sides are assigned the same throttled throughput value.</p><p>To view the list of throttled replicas:</p><pre><code>  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics
  Configs for topic 'my-topic' are leader.replication.throttled.replicas=1:102,0:101,
      follower.replication.throttled.replicas=1:101,0:102
</code></pre><p>Here we see the leader throttle is applied to partition 1 on broker 102 and partition 0 on broker 101. Likewise the follower throttle is applied to partition 1 on broker 101 and partition 0 on broker 102.</p><p>By default kafka-reassign-partitions.sh will apply the leader throttle to all replicas that exist before the rebalance, any one of which might be leader. It will apply the follower throttle to all move destinations. So if there is a partition with replicas on brokers 101,102, being reassigned to 102,103, a leader throttle, for that partition, would be applied to 101,102 and a follower throttle would be applied to 103 only.</p><p>If required, you can also use the &ndash;alter switch on kafka-configs.sh to alter the throttle configurations manually.</p><h3 id=safe-usage-of-throttled-replication>Safe usage of throttled replication<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#safe-usage-of-throttled-replication aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Some care should be taken when using throttled replication. In particular:</p><p><em>(1) Throttle Removal:</em></p><p>The throttle should be removed in a timely manner once reassignment completes (by running kafka-reassign-partitions —verify).</p><p><em>(2) Ensuring Progress:</em></p><p>If the throttle is set too low, in comparison to the incoming write rate, it is possible for replication to not make progress. This occurs when:</p><pre><code>max(BytesInPerSec) &gt; throttle
</code></pre><p>Where BytesInPerSec is the metric that monitors the write throughput of producers into each broker.</p><p>The administrator can monitor whether replication is making progress, during the rebalance, using the metric:</p><pre><code>kafka.server:type=FetcherLagMetrics,name=ConsumerLag,clientId=([-.\w]+),topic=([-.\w]+),partition=([0-9]+)
</code></pre><p>The lag should constantly decrease during replication. If the metric does not decrease the administrator should increase the throttle throughput as described above.</p><h2 id=setting-quotas>Setting quotas<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#setting-quotas aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Quotas overrides and defaults may be configured at (user, client-id), user or client-id levels as described here.

Our recommended approach to this is to deploy a local Kafka cluster in each datacenter with application instances in each datacenter interacting only with their local cluster and mirroring between clusters (see the documentation on the mirror maker tool for how to do this).</p><p>This deployment pattern allows datacenters to act as independent entities and allows us to manage and tune inter-datacenter replication centrally. This allows each facility to stand alone and operate even if the inter-datacenter links are unavailable: when this occurs the mirroring falls behind until the link is restored at which time it catches up.</p><p>For applications that need a global view of all data you can use mirroring to provide clusters which have aggregate data mirrored from the local clusters in <em>all</em> datacenters. These aggregate clusters are used for reads by applications that require the full data set.</p><p>This is not the only possible deployment pattern. It is possible to read from or write to a remote Kafka cluster over the WAN, though obviously this will add whatever latency is required to get the cluster.</p><p>Kafka naturally batches data in both the producer and consumer so it can achieve high-throughput even over a high-latency connection. To allow this though it may be necessary to increase the TCP socket buffer sizes for the producer, consumer, and broker using the <code>socket.send.buffer.bytes</code> and <code>socket.receive.buffer.bytes</code> configurations. The appropriate way to set this is documented <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product>here</a>.</p><p>It is generally <em>not</em> advisable to run a <em>single</em> Kafka cluster that spans multiple datacenters over a high-latency link. This will incur very high replication latency both for Kafka writes and ZooKeeper writes, and neither Kafka nor ZooKeeper will remain available in all locations if the network between locations is unavailable.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-363a420a80934f70c1abbc10491bd68b>6.3 - Kafka Configuration</h1><div class=lead>Kafka Configuration</div><h1 id=kafka-configuration>Kafka Configuration<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-configuration aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=important-client-configurations>Important Client Configurations<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#important-client-configurations aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The most important old Scala producer configurations control</p><ul><li>acks</li><li>compression</li><li>sync vs async production</li><li>batch size (for async producers)</li></ul><p>The most important new Java producer configurations control</p><ul><li>acks</li><li>compression</li><li>batch size</li></ul><p>The most important consumer configuration is the fetch size.</p><p>All configurations are documented in the configuration section.</p><h2 id=a-production-server-config>A Production Server Config<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#a-production-server-config aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Here is an example production server configuration:</p><pre><code>  # ZooKeeper

You can do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of memory needs by assuming you want to be able to buffer for 30 seconds and compute your memory need as write_throughput*30.</p><p>The disk throughput is important. We have 8x7200 rpm SATA drives. In general disk throughput is the performance bottleneck, and more disks is better. Depending on how you configure flush behavior you may or may not benefit from more expensive disks (if you force flush often then higher RPM SAS drives may be better).</p><h2 id=os>OS<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#os aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka should run well on any unix system and has been tested on Linux and Solaris.</p><p>We have seen a few issues running on Windows and Windows is not currently a well supported platform though we would be happy to change that.</p><p>It is unlikely to require much OS-level tuning, but there are two potentially important OS-level configurations:</p><ul><li>File descriptor limits: Kafka uses file descriptors for log segments and open connections. If a broker hosts many partitions, consider that the broker needs at least (number_of_partitions)*(partition_size/segment_size) to track all log segments in addition to the number of connections the broker makes. We recommend at least 100000 allowed file descriptors for the broker processes as a starting point.</li><li>Max socket buffer size: can be increased to enable high-performance data transfer between data centers as <a href=http://www.psc.edu/index.php/networking/641-tcp-tune>described here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=disks-and-filesystem>Disks and Filesystem<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#disks-and-filesystem aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>We recommend using multiple drives to get good throughput and not sharing the same drives used for Kafka data with application logs or other OS filesystem activity to ensure good latency. You can either RAID these drives together into a single volume or format and mount each drive as its own directory. Since Kafka has replication the redundancy provided by RAID can also be provided at the application level. This choice has several tradeoffs.</p><p>If you configure multiple data directories partitions will be assigned round-robin to data directories. Each partition will be entirely in one of the data directories. If data is not well balanced among partitions this can lead to load imbalance between disks.</p><p>RAID can potentially do better at balancing load between disks (although it doesn&rsquo;t always seem to) because it balances load at a lower level. The primary downside of RAID is that it is usually a big performance hit for write throughput and reduces the available disk space.</p><p>Another potential benefit of RAID is the ability to tolerate disk failures. However our experience has been that rebuilding the RAID array is so I/O intensive that it effectively disables the server, so this does not provide much real availability improvement.</p><h2 id=application-vs-os-flush-management>Application vs. OS Flush Management<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#application-vs-os-flush-management aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka always immediately writes all data to the filesystem and supports the ability to configure the flush policy that controls when data is forced out of the OS cache and onto disk using the flush. This flush policy can be controlled to force data to disk after a period of time or after a certain number of messages has been written. There are several choices in this configuration.</p><p>Kafka must eventually call fsync to know that data was flushed. When recovering from a crash for any log segment not known to be fsync&rsquo;d Kafka will check the integrity of each message by checking its CRC and also rebuild the accompanying offset index file as part of the recovery process executed on startup.</p><p>Note that durability in Kafka does not require syncing data to disk, as a failed node will always recover from its replicas.</p><p>We recommend using the default flush settings which disable application fsync entirely. This means relying on the background flush done by the OS and Kafka&rsquo;s own background flush. This provides the best of all worlds for most uses: no knobs to tune, great throughput and latency, and full recovery guarantees. We generally feel that the guarantees provided by replication are stronger than sync to local disk, however the paranoid still may prefer having both and application level fsync policies are still supported.</p><p>The drawback of using application level flush settings is that it is less efficient in its disk usage pattern (it gives the OS less leeway to re-order writes) and it can introduce latency as fsync in most Linux filesystems blocks writes to the file whereas the background flushing does much more granular page-level locking.</p><p>In general you don&rsquo;t need to do any low-level tuning of the filesystem, but in the next few sections we will go over some of this in case it is useful.</p><h2 id=understanding-linux-os-flush-behavior>Understanding Linux OS Flush Behavior<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#understanding-linux-os-flush-behavior aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>In Linux, data written to the filesystem is maintained in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache>pagecache</a> until it must be written out to disk (due to an application-level fsync or the OS&rsquo;s own flush policy). The flushing of data is done by a set of background threads called pdflush (or in post 2.6.32 kernels &ldquo;flusher threads&rdquo;).</p><p>Pdflush has a configurable policy that controls how much dirty data can be maintained in cache and for how long before it must be written back to disk. This policy is described <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20160518040713/http://www.westnet.com/~gsmith/content/linux-pdflush.htm>here</a>. When Pdflush cannot keep up with the rate of data being written it will eventually cause the writing process to block incurring latency in the writes to slow down the accumulation of data.</p><p>You can see the current state of OS memory usage by doing</p><pre><code> &gt; cat /proc/meminfo 
</code></pre><p>The meaning of these values are described in the link above.</p><p>Using pagecache has several advantages over an in-process cache for storing data that will be written out to disk:</p><ul><li>The I/O scheduler will batch together consecutive small writes into bigger physical writes which improves throughput.</li><li>The I/O scheduler will attempt to re-sequence writes to minimize movement of the disk head which improves throughput.</li><li>It automatically uses all the free memory on the machine</li></ul><h2 id=filesystem-selection>Filesystem Selection<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#filesystem-selection aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka uses regular files on disk, and as such it has no hard dependency on a specific filesystem. The two filesystems which have the most usage, however, are EXT4 and XFS. Historically, EXT4 has had more usage, but recent improvements to the XFS filesystem have shown it to have better performance characteristics for Kafka&rsquo;s workload with no compromise in stability.</p><p>Comparison testing was performed on a cluster with significant message loads, using a variety of filesystem creation and mount options. The primary metric in Kafka that was monitored was the &ldquo;Request Local Time&rdquo;, indicating the amount of time append operations were taking. XFS resulted in much better local times (160ms vs. 250ms+ for the best EXT4 configuration), as well as lower average wait times. The XFS performance also showed less variability in disk performance.</p><h3 id=general-filesystem-notes>General Filesystem Notes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#general-filesystem-notes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>For any filesystem used for data directories, on Linux systems, the following options are recommended to be used at mount time:</p><ul><li>noatime: This option disables updating of a file&rsquo;s atime (last access time) attribute when the file is read. This can eliminate a significant number of filesystem writes, especially in the case of bootstrapping consumers. Kafka does not rely on the atime attributes at all, so it is safe to disable this.</li></ul><h3 id=xfs-notes>XFS Notes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#xfs-notes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The XFS filesystem has a significant amount of auto-tuning in place, so it does not require any change in the default settings, either at filesystem creation time or at mount. The only tuning parameters worth considering are:</p><ul><li>largeio: This affects the preferred I/O size reported by the stat call. While this can allow for higher performance on larger disk writes, in practice it had minimal or no effect on performance.</li><li>nobarrier: For underlying devices that have battery-backed cache, this option can provide a little more performance by disabling periodic write flushes. However, if the underlying device is well-behaved, it will report to the filesystem that it does not require flushes, and this option will have no effect.</li></ul><h3 id=ext4-notes>EXT4 Notes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#ext4-notes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>EXT4 is a serviceable choice of filesystem for the Kafka data directories, however getting the most performance out of it will require adjusting several mount options. In addition, these options are generally unsafe in a failure scenario, and will result in much more data loss and corruption. For a single broker failure, this is not much of a concern as the disk can be wiped and the replicas rebuilt from the cluster. In a multiple-failure scenario, such as a power outage, this can mean underlying filesystem (and therefore data) corruption that is not easily recoverable. The following options can be adjusted:</p><ul><li>data=writeback: Ext4 defaults to data=ordered which puts a strong order on some writes. Kafka does not require this ordering as it does very paranoid data recovery on all unflushed log. This setting removes the ordering constraint and seems to significantly reduce latency.</li><li>Disabling journaling: Journaling is a tradeoff: it makes reboots faster after server crashes but it introduces a great deal of additional locking which adds variance to write performance. Those who don&rsquo;t care about reboot time and want to reduce a major source of write latency spikes can turn off journaling entirely.</li><li>commit=num_secs: This tunes the frequency with which ext4 commits to its metadata journal. Setting this to a lower value reduces the loss of unflushed data during a crash. Setting this to a higher value will improve throughput.</li><li>nobh: This setting controls additional ordering guarantees when using data=writeback mode. This should be safe with Kafka as we do not depend on write ordering and improves throughput and latency.</li><li>delalloc: Delayed allocation means that the filesystem avoid allocating any blocks until the physical write occurs. This allows ext4 to allocate a large extent instead of smaller pages and helps ensure the data is written sequentially. This feature is great for throughput. It does seem to involve some locking in the filesystem which adds a bit of latency variance.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e8ac65990dbcbb28c3f8316586a28666>6.6 - Monitoring</h1><div class=lead>Monitoring</div><h1 id=monitoring>Monitoring<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#monitoring aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka uses Yammer Metrics for metrics reporting in the server and Scala clients.

If you have a small deployment, then using 3 servers is acceptable, but keep in mind that you&rsquo;ll only be able to tolerate 1 server down in this case.</li><li>I/O segregation: if you do a lot of write type traffic you&rsquo;ll almost definitely want the transaction logs on a dedicated disk group. Writes to the transaction log are synchronous (but batched for performance), and consequently, concurrent writes can significantly affect performance. ZooKeeper snapshots can be one such a source of concurrent writes, and ideally should be written on a disk group separate from the transaction log. Snapshots are written to disk asynchronously, so it is typically ok to share with the operating system and message log files. You can configure a server to use a separate disk group with the dataLogDir parameter.</li><li>Application segregation: Unless you really understand the application patterns of other apps that you want to install on the same box, it can be a good idea to run ZooKeeper in isolation (though this can be a balancing act with the capabilities of the hardware).</li><li>Use care with virtualization: It can work, depending on your cluster layout and read/write patterns and SLAs, but the tiny overheads introduced by the virtualization layer can add up and throw off ZooKeeper, as it can be very time sensitive</li><li>ZooKeeper configuration: It&rsquo;s java, make sure you give it &rsquo;enough&rsquo; heap space (We usually run them with 3-5G, but that&rsquo;s mostly due to the data set size we have here). Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have a good formula for it, but keep in mind that allowing for more ZooKeeper state means that snapshots can become large, and large snapshots affect recovery time. In fact, if the snapshot becomes too large (a few gigabytes), then you may need to increase the initLimit parameter to give enough time for servers to recover and join the ensemble.</li><li>Monitoring: Both JMX and the 4 letter words (4lw) commands are very useful, they do overlap in some cases (and in those cases we prefer the 4 letter commands, they seem more predictable, or at the very least, they work better with the LI monitoring infrastructure)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t overbuild the cluster: large clusters, especially in a write heavy usage pattern, means a lot of intracluster communication (quorums on the writes and subsequent cluster member updates), but don&rsquo;t underbuild it (and risk swamping the cluster). Having more servers adds to your read capacity.</li></ul><p>Overall, we try to keep the ZooKeeper system as small as will handle the load (plus standard growth capacity planning) and as simple as possible. We try not to do anything fancy with the configuration or application layout as compared to the official release as well as keep it as self contained as possible. For these reasons, we tend to skip the OS packaged versions, since it has a tendency to try to put things in the OS standard hierarchy, which can be &lsquo;messy&rsquo;, for want of a better way to word it.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-cd79fd04bcbc55245176b6f6c61ea985>7 - Security</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-466819bcc0c8aa5aaa6749e733cf73c0>7.1 - Security Overview</h1><div class=lead>Security Overview</div><h1 id=security-overview>Security Overview<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#security-overview aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>In release 0.9.0.0, the Kafka community added a number of features that, used either separately or together, increases security in a Kafka cluster. The following security measures are currently supported:</p><ol><li>Authentication of connections to brokers from clients (producers and consumers), other brokers and tools, using either SSL or SASL. Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms:<ul><li>SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0</li><li>SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0</li><li>SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.10.2.0</li></ul></li><li>Authentication of connections from brokers to ZooKeeper</li><li>Encryption of data transferred between brokers and clients, between brokers, or between brokers and tools using SSL (Note that there is a performance degradation when SSL is enabled, the magnitude of which depends on the CPU type and the JVM implementation.)</li><li>Authorization of read / write operations by clients</li><li>Authorization is pluggable and integration with external authorization services is supported</li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients. The guides below explain how to configure and use the security features in both clients and brokers.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-32096e8fb5f1df8504a98aa669f82ea9>7.2 - Encryption and Authentication using SSL</h1><div class=lead>Encryption and Authentication using SSL</div><h1 id=encryption-and-authentication-using-ssl>Encryption and Authentication using SSL<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#encryption-and-authentication-using-ssl aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Apache Kafka allows clients to connect over SSL.

You can use Java&rsquo;s keytool utility to accomplish this task. We will generate the key into a temporary keystore initially so that we can export and sign it later with CA.</p><pre><code>                keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA
</code></pre><p>You need to specify two parameters in the above command:
1. keystore: the keystore file that stores the certificate. The keystore file contains the private key of the certificate; therefore, it needs to be kept safely.
2. validity: the valid time of the certificate in days.</p><p>Note: By default the property <code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code> is not defined, so hostname verification is not performed. In order to enable hostname verification, set the following property:</p><pre><code>    	ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=HTTPS 
</code></pre><p>Once enabled, clients will verify the server&rsquo;s fully qualified domain name (FQDN) against one of the following two fields:
1. Common Name (CN)
2. Subject Alternative Name (SAN)<br>Both fields are valid, RFC-2818 recommends the use of SAN however. SAN is also more flexible, allowing for multiple DNS entries to be declared. Another advantage is that the CN can be set to a more meaningful value for authorization purposes. To add a SAN field append the following argument <code>-ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN}</code> to the keytool command:</p><pre><code>            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity {validity} -genkey -keyalg RSA -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN}
</code></pre><p>The following command can be run afterwards to verify the contents of the generated certificate:</p><pre><code>            keytool -list -v -keystore server.keystore.jks
</code></pre><ol start=2><li><h4 id=creating-your-own-ca>Creating your own CA<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#creating-your-own-ca aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4></li></ol><p>After the first step, each machine in the cluster has a public-private key pair, and a certificate to identify the machine. The certificate, however, is unsigned, which means that an attacker can create such a certificate to pretend to be any machine.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to prevent forged certificates by signing them for each machine in the cluster. A certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. CA works likes a government that issues passports—the government stamps (signs) each passport so that the passport becomes difficult to forge. Other governments verify the stamps to ensure the passport is authentic. Similarly, the CA signs the certificates, and the cryptography guarantees that a signed certificate is computationally difficult to forge. Thus, as long as the CA is a genuine and trusted authority, the clients have high assurance that they are connecting to the authentic machines.</p><pre><code>                openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days 365
</code></pre><p>The generated CA is simply a public-private key pair and certificate, and it is intended to sign other certificates.<br>The next step is to add the generated CA to the <strong>clients&rsquo; truststore</strong> so that the clients can trust this CA:</p><pre><code>                keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you configure the Kafka brokers to require client authentication by setting ssl.client.auth to be &ldquo;requested&rdquo; or &ldquo;required&rdquo; on the Kafka brokers config then you must provide a truststore for the Kafka brokers as well and it should have all the CA certificates that clients&rsquo; keys were signed by.</p><pre><code>                keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
</code></pre><p>In contrast to the keystore in step 1 that stores each machine&rsquo;s own identity, the truststore of a client stores all the certificates that the client should trust. Importing a certificate into one&rsquo;s truststore also means trusting all certificates that are signed by that certificate. As the analogy above, trusting the government (CA) also means trusting all passports (certificates) that it has issued. This attribute is called the chain of trust, and it is particularly useful when deploying SSL on a large Kafka cluster. You can sign all certificates in the cluster with a single CA, and have all machines share the same truststore that trusts the CA. That way all machines can authenticate all other machines.
3. #### Signing the certificate</p><p>The next step is to sign all certificates generated by step 1 with the CA generated in step 2. First, you need to export the certificate from the keystore:</p><pre><code>                keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -certreq -file cert-file
</code></pre><p>Then sign it with the CA:</p><pre><code>                openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days {validity} -CAcreateserial -passin pass:{ca-password}
</code></pre><p>Finally, you need to import both the certificate of the CA and the signed certificate into the keystore:</p><pre><code>                keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed
</code></pre><p>The definitions of the parameters are the following:
1. keystore: the location of the keystore
2. ca-cert: the certificate of the CA
3. ca-key: the private key of the CA
4. ca-password: the passphrase of the CA
5. cert-file: the exported, unsigned certificate of the server
6. cert-signed: the signed certificate of the server
Here is an example of a bash script with all above steps. Note that one of the commands assumes a password of <code>test1234</code>, so either use that password or edit the command before running it.</p><pre><code>                #!/bin/bash
            #Step 1
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -genkey
            #Step 2
            openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days 365
            keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            #Step 3
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -certreq -file cert-file
            openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:test1234
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert
            keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed

We need to configure the following property in server.properties, which must have one or more comma-separated values:</p><pre><code>    listeners
</code></pre><p>If SSL is not enabled for inter-broker communication (see below for how to enable it), both PLAINTEXT and SSL ports will be necessary.</p><pre><code>                listeners=PLAINTEXT://host.name:port,SSL://host.name:port
</code></pre><p>Following SSL configs are needed on the broker side</p><pre><code>                ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234
</code></pre><p>Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled. Optional settings that are worth considering:
1. ssl.client.auth=none (&ldquo;required&rdquo; => client authentication is required, &ldquo;requested&rdquo; => client authentication is requested and client without certs can still connect. The usage of &ldquo;requested&rdquo; is discouraged as it provides a false sense of security and misconfigured clients will still connect successfully.)
2. ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. (Default is an empty list)
3. ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1 (list out the SSL protocols that you are going to accept from clients. Do note that SSL is deprecated in favor of TLS and using SSL in production is not recommended)
4. ssl.keystore.type=JKS
5. ssl.truststore.type=JKS
6. ssl.secure.random.implementation=SHA1PRNG
If you want to enable SSL for inter-broker communication, add the following to the broker properties file (it defaults to PLAINTEXT)</p><pre><code>                security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
</code></pre><p>Due to import regulations in some countries, the Oracle implementation limits the strength of cryptographic algorithms available by default. If stronger algorithms are needed (for example, AES with 256-bit keys), the <a href=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</a> must be obtained and installed in the JDK/JRE. See the <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html>JCA Providers Documentation</a> for more information.</p><p>The JRE/JDK will have a default pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that is used for cryptography operations, so it is not required to configure the implementation used with the</p><pre><code>    ssl.secure.random.implementation
</code></pre><p>. However, there are performance issues with some implementations (notably, the default chosen on Linux systems,</p><pre><code>    NativePRNG
</code></pre><p>, utilizes a global lock). In cases where performance of SSL connections becomes an issue, consider explicitly setting the implementation to be used. The</p><pre><code>    SHA1PRNG
</code></pre><p>implementation is non-blocking, and has shown very good performance characteristics under heavy load (50 MB/sec of produced messages, plus replication traffic, per-broker).</p><p>Once you start the broker you should be able to see in the server.log</p><pre><code>                with addresses: PLAINTEXT -&gt; EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9092,PLAINTEXT),SSL -&gt; EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9093,SSL)
</code></pre><p>To check quickly if the server keystore and truststore are setup properly you can run the following command</p><pre><code>    openssl s_client -debug -connect localhost:9093 -tls1
</code></pre><p>(Note: TLSv1 should be listed under ssl.enabled.protocols)<br>In the output of this command you should see server&rsquo;s certificate:</p><pre><code>                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            {variable sized random bytes}
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            subject=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=Sriharsha Chintalapani
            issuer=/C=US/ST=CA/L=Santa Clara/O=org/OU=org/CN=kafka/emailAddress=test@test.com
</code></pre><p>If the certificate does not show up or if there are any other error messages then your keystore is not setup properly.
5. #### Configuring Kafka Clients</p><p>SSL is supported only for the new Kafka Producer and Consumer, the older API is not supported. The configs for SSL will be the same for both producer and consumer.<br>If client authentication is not required in the broker, then the following is a minimal configuration example:</p><pre><code>                security.protocol=SSL
            ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.truststore.jks
            ssl.truststore.password=test1234
</code></pre><p>Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled. If client authentication is required, then a keystore must be created like in step 1 and the following must also be configured:</p><pre><code>                ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.keystore.jks
            ssl.keystore.password=test1234
            ssl.key.password=test1234
</code></pre><p>Other configuration settings that may also be needed depending on our requirements and the broker configuration:
1. ssl.provider (Optional). The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.
2. ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol.
3. ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1. It should list at least one of the protocols configured on the broker side
4. ssl.truststore.type=JKS

</code></pre><p>Clients may specify JAAS configuration as a producer or consumer property without creating a physical configuration file. This mode also enables different producers and consumers within the same JVM to use different credentials by specifying different properties for each client. If both static JAAS configuration system property <code>java.security.auth.login.config</code> and client property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code> are specified, the client property will be used.</p><p>See GSSAPI (Kerberos), PLAIN or SCRAM for example configurations.</p><pre><code>  2. ###### JAAS configuration using static config file
</code></pre><p>To configure SASL authentication on the clients using static JAAS config file:
1. Add a JAAS config file with a client login section named <code>KafkaClient</code>. Configure a login module in <code>KafkaClient</code> for the selected mechanism as described in the examples for setting up GSSAPI (Kerberos), PLAIN or SCRAM. For example, GSSAPI credentials may be configured as:</p><pre><code>                                    KafkaClient {
                    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
                    useKeyTab=true
                    storeKey=true
                    keyTab=&quot;/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab&quot;
                    principal=&quot;kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM&quot;;
                };

    2. Pass the JAAS config file location as JVM parameter to each client JVM. For example: 
            
                                -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_client_jaas.conf

If SASL_SSL is used, then SSL must also be configured.</p><pre><code>1. ##### SASL mechanisms
</code></pre><p>Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms:
* GSSAPI (Kerberos)
* PLAIN
* SCRAM-SHA-256
* SCRAM-SHA-512
2. ##### SASL configuration for Kafka brokers</p><pre><code>  1. Configure a SASL port in server.properties, by adding at least one of SASL_PLAINTEXT or SASL_SSL to the _listeners_ parameter, which contains one or more comma-separated values: 
        
                        listeners=SASL_PLAINTEXT://host.name:port
</code></pre><p>If you are only configuring a SASL port (or if you want the Kafka brokers to authenticate each other using SASL) then make sure you set the same SASL protocol for inter-broker communication:</p><pre><code>                        security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT (or SASL_SSL)

  2. Select one or more supported mechanisms to enable in the broker and follow the steps to configure SASL for the mechanism. To enable multiple mechanisms in the broker, follow the steps here.

</code></pre><p>SASL authentication is only supported for the new Java Kafka producer and consumer, the older API is not supported.</p><p>To configure SASL authentication on the clients, select a SASL mechanism that is enabled in the broker for client authentication and follow the steps to configure SASL for the selected mechanism.</p><ol start=3><li><h4 id=authentication-using-saslkerberos>Authentication using SASL/Kerberos<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#authentication-using-saslkerberos aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4></li></ol><pre><code>1. ##### Prerequisites

  1. **Kerberos**  
</code></pre><p>If your organization is already using a Kerberos server (for example, by using Active Directory), there is no need to install a new server just for Kafka. Otherwise you will need to install one, your Linux vendor likely has packages for Kerberos and a short guide on how to install and configure it (<a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kerberos>Ubuntu</a>, <a href=https://access.redhat.com/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/installing-kerberos.html>Redhat</a>). Note that if you are using Oracle Java, you will need to download JCE policy files for your Java version and copy them to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security.
2. <strong>Create Kerberos Principals</strong><br>If you are using the organization&rsquo;s Kerberos or Active Directory server, ask your Kerberos administrator for a principal for each Kafka broker in your cluster and for every operating system user that will access Kafka with Kerberos authentication (via clients and tools). If you have installed your own Kerberos, you will need to create these principals yourself using the following commands:</p><pre><code>                            sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q 'addprinc -randkey kafka/{hostname}@{REALM}'
                sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q &quot;ktadd -k /etc/security/keytabs/{keytabname}.keytab kafka/{hostname}@{REALM}&quot;

  3. **Make sure all hosts can be reachable using hostnames** \- it is a Kerberos requirement that all your hosts can be resolved with their FQDNs.
2. ##### Configuring Kafka Brokers

  1. Add a suitably modified JAAS file similar to the one below to each Kafka broker's config directory, let's call it kafka_server_jaas.conf for this example (note that each broker should have its own keytab): 
        
                            KafkaServer {
                    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
                    useKeyTab=true
                    storeKey=true
                    keyTab=&quot;/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_server.keytab&quot;
                    principal=&quot;kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@EXAMPLE.COM&quot;;
                };
        
                // Zookeeper client authentication
                Client {
                com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
                useKeyTab=true
                storeKey=true
                keyTab=&quot;/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_server.keytab&quot;
                principal=&quot;kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@EXAMPLE.COM&quot;;
                };
</code></pre><p><code>KafkaServer</code> section in the JAAS file tells the broker which principal to use and the location of the keytab where this principal is stored. It allows the broker to login using the keytab specified in this section. See notes for more details on Zookeeper SASL configuration.
2. Pass the JAAS and optionally the krb5 file locations as JVM parameters to each Kafka broker (see <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html>here</a> for more details):</p><pre><code>                        -Djava.security.krb5.conf=/etc/kafka/krb5.conf
                -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_server_jaas.conf

  3. Make sure the keytabs configured in the JAAS file are readable by the operating system user who is starting kafka broker.
  4. Configure SASL port and SASL mechanisms in server.properties as described here. For example: 
        
                        listeners=SASL_PLAINTEXT://host.name:port
                security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
                sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=GSSAPI
                sasl.enabled.mechanisms=GSSAPI
</code></pre><p>We must also configure the service name in server.properties, which should match the principal name of the kafka brokers. In the above example, principal is &ldquo;<a href=mailto:kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@EXAMPLE.com>kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@EXAMPLE.com</a>&rdquo;, so:</p><pre><code>                        sasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka

3. ##### Configuring Kafka Clients
</code></pre><p>To configure SASL authentication on the clients:
1. Clients (producers, consumers, connect workers, etc) will authenticate to the cluster with their own principal (usually with the same name as the user running the client), so obtain or create these principals as needed. Then configure the JAAS configuration property for each client. Different clients within a JVM may run as different users by specifiying different principals. The property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code> in producer.properties or consumer.properties describes how clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example configuration for a client using a keytab (recommended for long-running processes):</p><pre><code>                        sasl.jaas.config=com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required \
                useKeyTab=true \
                storeKey=true  \
                keyTab=&quot;/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab&quot; \
                principal=&quot;kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM&quot;;
</code></pre><p>For command-line utilities like kafka-console-consumer or kafka-console-producer, kinit can be used along with &ldquo;useTicketCache=true&rdquo; as in:</p><pre><code>                        sasl.jaas.config=com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required \
                useTicketCache=true;
</code></pre><p>JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers as described here. Clients use the login section named <code>KafkaClient</code>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.
2. Make sure the keytabs configured in the JAAS configuration are readable by the operating system user who is starting kafka client.
3. Optionally pass the krb5 file locations as JVM parameters to each client JVM (see <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html>here</a> for more details):</p><pre><code>                        -Djava.security.krb5.conf=/etc/kafka/krb5.conf

  4. Configure the following properties in producer.properties or consumer.properties: 
        
                        security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT (or SASL_SSL)
            sasl.mechanism=GSSAPI
            sasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka

Kafka supports a default implementation for SASL/PLAIN which can be extended for production use as described here.</p><p>The username is used as the authenticated <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc.
1. ##### Configuring Kafka Brokers</p><pre><code>  1. Add a suitably modified JAAS file similar to the one below to each Kafka broker's config directory, let's call it kafka_server_jaas.conf for this example: 
        
                            KafkaServer {
                    org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
                    username=&quot;admin&quot;
                    password=&quot;admin-secret&quot;
                    user_admin=&quot;admin-secret&quot;
                    user_alice=&quot;alice-secret&quot;;
                };
</code></pre><p>This configuration defines two users (<em>admin</em> and <em>alice</em>). The properties <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> in the <code>KafkaServer</code> section are used by the broker to initiate connections to other brokers. In this example, <em>admin</em> is the user for inter-broker communication. The set of properties <code>user__userName_</code> defines the passwords for all users that connect to the broker and the broker validates all client connections including those from other brokers using these properties.
2. Pass the JAAS config file location as JVM parameter to each Kafka broker:</p><pre><code>                        -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_server_jaas.conf

  3. Configure SASL port and SASL mechanisms in server.properties as described here. For example: 
        
                        listeners=SASL_SSL://host.name:port
                security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_SSL
                sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=PLAIN
                sasl.enabled.mechanisms=PLAIN

2. ##### Configuring Kafka Clients
</code></pre><p>To configure SASL authentication on the clients:
1. Configure the JAAS configuration property for each client in producer.properties or consumer.properties. The login module describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example configuration for a client for the PLAIN mechanism:</p><pre><code>                        sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required \
                username=&quot;alice&quot; \
                password=&quot;alice-secret&quot;;
</code></pre><p>The options <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> are used by clients to configure the user for client connections. In this example, clients connect to the broker as user <em>alice</em>. Different clients within a JVM may connect as different users by specifying different user names and passwords in <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.</p><p>JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers as described here. Clients use the login section named <code>KafkaClient</code>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.</p><pre><code>  2. Configure the following properties in producer.properties or consumer.properties: 
        
                        security.protocol=SASL_SSL
            sasl.mechanism=PLAIN

3. ##### Use of SASL/PLAIN in production

   * SASL/PLAIN should be used only with SSL as transport layer to ensure that clear passwords are not transmitted on the wire without encryption.
   * The default implementation of SASL/PLAIN in Kafka specifies usernames and passwords in the JAAS configuration file as shown here. To avoid storing passwords on disk, you can plug in your own implementation of `javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule` that provides usernames and passwords from an external source. The login module implementation should provide username as the public credential and password as the private credential of the `Subject`. The default implementation `org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule` can be used as an example.
   * In production systems, external authentication servers may implement password authentication. Kafka brokers can be integrated with these servers by adding your own implementation of `javax.security.sasl.SaslServer`. The default implementation included in Kafka in the package `org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain` can be used as an example to get started. 
     * New providers must be installed and registered in the JVM. Providers can be installed by adding provider classes to the normal `CLASSPATH` or bundled as a jar file and added to `_JAVA_HOME_ /lib/ext`.
     * Providers can be registered statically by adding a provider to the security properties file `_JAVA_HOME_ /lib/security/java.security`. 
            
                                security.provider.n=providerClassName
</code></pre><p>where <em>providerClassName</em> is the fully qualified name of the new provider and <em>n</em> is the preference order with lower numbers indicating higher preference.
* Alternatively, you can register providers dynamically at runtime by invoking <code>Security.addProvider</code> at the beginning of the client application or in a static initializer in the login module. For example:</p><pre><code>                                Security.addProvider(new PlainSaslServerProvider());

     * For more details, see [JCA Reference](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html).

The mechanism is defined in <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>RFC 5802</a>. Kafka supports <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677>SCRAM-SHA-256</a> and SCRAM-SHA-512 which can be used with TLS to perform secure authentication. The username is used as the authenticated <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc. The default SCRAM implementation in Kafka stores SCRAM credentials in Zookeeper and is suitable for use in Kafka installations where Zookeeper is on a private network. Refer to Security Considerations for more details.</p><pre><code>1. ##### Creating SCRAM Credentials
</code></pre><p>The SCRAM implementation in Kafka uses Zookeeper as credential store. Credentials can be created in Zookeeper using <code>kafka-configs.sh</code>. For each SCRAM mechanism enabled, credentials must be created by adding a config with the mechanism name. Credentials for inter-broker communication must be created before Kafka brokers are started. Client credentials may be created and updated dynamically and updated credentials will be used to authenticate new connections.</p><p>Create SCRAM credentials for user <em>alice</em> with password <em>alice-secret</em> :</p><pre><code>                &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[iterations=8192,password=alice-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=alice-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name alice
</code></pre><p>The default iteration count of 4096 is used if iterations are not specified. A random salt is created and the SCRAM identity consisting of salt, iterations, StoredKey and ServerKey are stored in Zookeeper. See <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>RFC 5802</a> for details on SCRAM identity and the individual fields.</p><p>The following examples also require a user <em>admin</em> for inter-broker communication which can be created using:</p><pre><code>                &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[password=admin-secret],SCRAM-SHA-512=[password=admin-secret]' --entity-type users --entity-name admin
</code></pre><p>Existing credentials may be listed using the <em>--describe</em> option:</p><pre><code>                &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --describe --entity-type users --entity-name alice
</code></pre><p>Credentials may be deleted for one or more SCRAM mechanisms using the <em>--delete</em> option:</p><pre><code>                &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --delete-config 'SCRAM-SHA-512' --entity-type users --entity-name alice
            

2. ##### Configuring Kafka Brokers

  1. Add a suitably modified JAAS file similar to the one below to each Kafka broker's config directory, let's call it kafka_server_jaas.conf for this example: 
        
                        KafkaServer {
                org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required
                username=&quot;admin&quot;
                password=&quot;admin-secret&quot;;
            };
</code></pre><p>The properties <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> in the <code>KafkaServer</code> section are used by the broker to initiate connections to other brokers. In this example, <em>admin</em> is the user for inter-broker communication.
2. Pass the JAAS config file location as JVM parameter to each Kafka broker:</p><pre><code>                        -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_server_jaas.conf

  3. Configure SASL port and SASL mechanisms in server.properties as described here.`
</code></pre><p>For example:</p><pre><code>                        listeners=SASL_SSL://host.name:port
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_SSL
            sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=SCRAM-SHA-256 (or SCRAM-SHA-512)
            sasl.enabled.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-256 (or SCRAM-SHA-512)

3. ##### Configuring Kafka Clients
</code></pre><p>To configure SASL authentication on the clients:
1. Configure the JAAS configuration property for each client in producer.properties or consumer.properties. The login module describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example configuration for a client for the SCRAM mechanisms:</p><pre><code>                       sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
                username=&quot;alice&quot; \
                password=&quot;alice-secret&quot;;
</code></pre><p>The options <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> are used by clients to configure the user for client connections. In this example, clients connect to the broker as user <em>alice</em>. Different clients within a JVM may connect as different users by specifying different user names and passwords in <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.</p><p>JAAS configuration for clients may alternatively be specified as a JVM parameter similar to brokers as described here. Clients use the login section named <code>KafkaClient</code>. This option allows only one user for all client connections from a JVM.</p><pre><code>  2. Configure the following properties in producer.properties or consumer.properties: 
        
                        security.protocol=SASL_SSL
            sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256 (or SCRAM-SHA-512)

4. ##### Security Considerations for SASL/SCRAM

   * The default implementation of SASL/SCRAM in Kafka stores SCRAM credentials in Zookeeper. This is suitable for production use in installations where Zookeeper is secure and on a private network.
   * Kafka supports only the strong hash functions SHA-256 and SHA-512 with a minimum iteration count of 4096. Strong hash functions combined with strong passwords and high iteration counts protect against brute force attacks if Zookeeper security is compromised.
   * SCRAM should be used only with TLS-encryption to prevent interception of SCRAM exchanges. This protects against dictionary or brute force attacks and against impersonation if Zookeeper is compromised.
   * The default SASL/SCRAM implementation may be overridden using custom login modules in installations where Zookeeper is not secure. See here for details.
   * For more details on security considerations, refer to [RFC 5802](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#section-9).

2. Enable the SASL mechanisms in server.properties: 
    
                sasl.enabled.mechanisms=GSSAPI,PLAIN,SCRAM-SHA-256,SCRAM-SHA-512

3. Specify the SASL security protocol and mechanism for inter-broker communication in server.properties if required: 
    
                security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT (or SASL_SSL)
        sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=GSSAPI (or one of the other enabled mechanisms)

4. Follow the mechanism-specific steps in GSSAPI (Kerberos), PLAIN and SCRAM to configure SASL for the enabled mechanisms.

Kafka acls are defined in the general format of &ldquo;Principal P is [Allowed/Denied] Operation O From Host H On Resource R&rdquo;. You can read more about the acl structure on KIP-11. In order to add, remove or list acls you can use the Kafka authorizer CLI. By default, if a Resource R has no associated acls, no one other than super users is allowed to access R. If you want to change that behavior, you can include the following in broker.properties.</p><pre><code>allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=true
</code></pre><p>One can also add super users in broker.properties like the following (note that the delimiter is semicolon since SSL user names may contain comma).</p><pre><code>super.users=User:Bob;User:Alice
</code></pre><p>By default, the SSL user name will be of the form &ldquo;CN=writeuser,OU=Unknown,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown&rdquo;. One can change that by setting a customized PrincipalBuilder in broker.properties like the following.</p><pre><code>principal.builder.class=CustomizedPrincipalBuilderClass
</code></pre><p>By default, the SASL user name will be the primary part of the Kerberos principal. One can change that by setting <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> to a customized rule in broker.properties. The format of <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> is a list where each rule works in the same way as the auth_to_local in <a href=http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html>Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf)</a>. Each rules starts with RULE: and contains an expression in the format <a href=regexp>n:string</a>s/pattern/replacement/g. See the kerberos documentation for more details. An example of adding a rule to properly translate <a href=mailto:user@MYDOMAIN.COM>user@MYDOMAIN.COM</a> to user while also keeping the default rule in place is:</p><pre><code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules=RULE:[1:$1@$0](.*@MYDOMAIN.COM)s/@.*//,DEFAULT

You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:</p><pre><code>bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic
</code></pre></li></ul><p>By default, all principals that don&rsquo;t have an explicit acl that allows access for an operation to a resource are denied. In rare cases where an allow acl is defined that allows access to all but some principal we will have to use the &ndash;deny-principal and &ndash;deny-host option. For example, if we want to allow all users to Read from Test-topic but only deny User:BadBob from IP 198.51.100.3 we can do so using following commands:</p><pre><code>    bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:* --allow-host * --deny-principal User:BadBob --deny-host 198.51.100.3 --operation Read --topic Test-topic
</code></pre><p>Note that <code>--allow-host</code> and <code>deny-host</code> only support IP addresses (hostnames are not supported). Above examples add acls to a topic by specifying &ndash;topic [topic-name] as the resource option. Similarly user can add acls to cluster by specifying &ndash;cluster and to a consumer group by specifying &ndash;group [group-name].</p><ul><li><p><strong>Removing Acls</strong><br>Removing acls is pretty much the same. The only difference is instead of &ndash;add option users will have to specify &ndash;remove option. To remove the acls added by the first example above we can execute the CLI with following options:</p><pre><code> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --remove --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host 198.51.100.0 --allow-host 198.51.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic 
</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>List Acls</strong><br>We can list acls for any resource by specifying the &ndash;list option with the resource. To list all acls for Test-topic we can execute the CLI with following options:</p><pre><code>bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --list --topic Test-topic
</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Adding or removing a principal as producer or consumer</strong><br>The most common use case for acl management are adding/removing a principal as producer or consumer so we added convenience options to handle these cases. In order to add User:Bob as a producer of Test-topic we can execute the following command:</p><pre><code> bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic
</code></pre></li></ul><p>Similarly to add Alice as a consumer of Test-topic with consumer group Group-1 we just have to pass &ndash;consumer option:</p><pre><code>     bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1 
</code></pre><p>Note that for consumer option we must also specify the consumer group.

This is done in phases:</p><ul><li>Incrementally bounce the cluster nodes to open additional secured port(s).</li><li>Restart clients using the secured rather than PLAINTEXT port (assuming you are securing the client-broker connection).</li><li>Incrementally bounce the cluster again to enable broker-to-broker security (if this is required)</li><li>A final incremental bounce to close the PLAINTEXT port.</li></ul><p>The specific steps for configuring SSL and SASL are described in sections 7.2 and 7.3. Follow these steps to enable security for your desired protocol(s).</p><p>The security implementation lets you configure different protocols for both broker-client and broker-broker communication. These must be enabled in separate bounces. A PLAINTEXT port must be left open throughout so brokers and/or clients can continue to communicate.</p><p>When performing an incremental bounce stop the brokers cleanly via a SIGTERM. It&rsquo;s also good practice to wait for restarted replicas to return to the ISR list before moving onto the next node.</p><p>As an example, say we wish to encrypt both broker-client and broker-broker communication with SSL. In the first incremental bounce, a SSL port is opened on each node:</p><pre><code>            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
</code></pre><p>We then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, secured port:</p><pre><code>            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9092,...]
            security.protocol = SSL
            ...etc
</code></pre><p>In the second incremental server bounce we instruct Kafka to use SSL as the broker-broker protocol (which will use the same SSL port):</p><pre><code>            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
</code></pre><p>In the final bounce we secure the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port:</p><pre><code>            listeners=SSL://broker1:9092
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
</code></pre><p>Alternatively we might choose to open multiple ports so that different protocols can be used for broker-broker and broker-client communication. Say we wished to use SSL encryption throughout (i.e. for broker-broker and broker-client communication) but we&rsquo;d like to add SASL authentication to the broker-client connection also. We would achieve this by opening two additional ports during the first bounce:</p><pre><code>            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
</code></pre><p>We would then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, SASL & SSL secured port:</p><pre><code>            bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9093,...]
            security.protocol = SASL_SSL
            ...etc
</code></pre><p>The second server bounce would switch the cluster to use encrypted broker-broker communication via the SSL port we previously opened on port 9092:</p><pre><code>            listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
            security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
</code></pre><p>The final bounce secures the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port.</p><pre><code>        listeners=SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
        security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL

It makes it simple to quickly define <em>connectors</em> that move large collections of data into and out of Kafka. Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from all your application servers into Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. An export job can deliver data from Kafka topics into secondary storage and query systems or into batch systems for offline analysis. Kafka Connect features include:</p><ul><li><strong>A common framework for Kafka connectors</strong> - Kafka Connect standardizes integration of other data systems with Kafka, simplifying connector development, deployment, and management</li><li><strong>Distributed and standalone modes</strong> - scale up to a large, centrally managed service supporting an entire organization or scale down to development, testing, and small production deployments</li><li><strong>REST interface</strong> - submit and manage connectors to your Kafka Connect cluster via an easy to use REST API</li><li><strong>Automatic offset management</strong> - with just a little information from connectors, Kafka Connect can manage the offset commit process automatically so connector developers do not need to worry about this error prone part of connector development</li><li><strong>Distributed and scalable by default</strong> - Kafka Connect builds on the existing group management protocol. More workers can be added to scale up a Kafka Connect cluster.</li><li><strong>Streaming/batch integration</strong> - leveraging Kafka&rsquo;s existing capabilities, Kafka Connect is an ideal solution for bridging streaming and batch data systems</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-818f585e99e916d06782ca997c52ebea>8.2 - User Guide</h1><div class=lead>User Guide</div><h1 id=user-guide>User Guide<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#user-guide aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>The quickstart provides a brief example of how to run a standalone version of Kafka Connect. This section describes how to configure, run, and manage Kafka Connect in more detail.</p><h2 id=running-kafka-connect>Running Kafka Connect<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#running-kafka-connect aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka Connect currently supports two modes of execution: standalone (single process) and distributed. In standalone mode all work is performed in a single process. This configuration is simpler to setup and get started with and may be useful in situations where only one worker makes sense (e.g. collecting log files), but it does not benefit from some of the features of Kafka Connect such as fault tolerance. You can start a standalone process with the following command:</p><pre><code>    &gt; bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties connector1.properties [connector2.properties ...]
</code></pre><p>The first parameter is the configuration for the worker. This includes settings such as the Kafka connection parameters, serialization format, and how frequently to commit offsets. The provided example should work well with a local cluster running with the default configuration provided by <code>config/server.properties</code>. It will require tweaking to use with a different configuration or production deployment. All workers (both standalone and distributed) require a few configs:</p><ul><li><code>bootstrap.servers</code> - List of Kafka servers used to bootstrap connections to Kafka</li><li><code>key.converter</code> - Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the keys in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.</li><li><code>value.converter</code> - Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the values in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.</li></ul><p>The important configuration options specific to standalone mode are:</p><ul><li><code>offset.storage.file.filename</code> - File to store offset data in</li></ul><p>The parameters that are configured here are intended for producers and consumers used by Kafka Connect to access the configuration, offset and status topics. For configuration of Kafka source and Kafka sink tasks, the same parameters can be used but need to be prefixed with <code>consumer.</code> and <code>producer.</code> respectively. The only parameter that is inherited from the worker configuration is <code>bootstrap.servers</code>, which in most cases will be sufficient, since the same cluster is often used for all purposes. A notable exeption is a secured cluster, which requires extra parameters to allow connections. These parameters will need to be set up to three times in the worker configuration, once for management access, once for Kafka sinks and once for Kafka sources. The remaining parameters are connector configuration files. You may include as many as you want, but all will execute within the same process (on different threads). Distributed mode handles automatic balancing of work, allows you to scale up (or down) dynamically, and offers fault tolerance both in the active tasks and for configuration and offset commit data. Execution is very similar to standalone mode:</p><pre><code>    &gt; bin/connect-distributed.sh config/connect-distributed.properties
</code></pre><p>The difference is in the class which is started and the configuration parameters which change how the Kafka Connect process decides where to store configurations, how to assign work, and where to store offsets and task statues. In the distributed mode, Kafka Connect stores the offsets, configs and task statuses in Kafka topics. It is recommended to manually create the topics for offset, configs and statuses in order to achieve the desired the number of partitions and replication factors. If the topics are not yet created when starting Kafka Connect, the topics will be auto created with default number of partitions and replication factor, which may not be best suited for its usage. In particular, the following configuration parameters, in addition to the common settings mentioned above, are critical to set before starting your cluster:</p><ul><li><code>group.id</code> (default <code>connect-cluster</code>) - unique name for the cluster, used in forming the Connect cluster group; note that this <strong>must not conflict</strong> with consumer group IDs</li><li><code>config.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-configs</code>) - topic to use for storing connector and task configurations; note that this should be a single partition, highly replicated, compacted topic. You may need to manually create the topic to ensure the correct configuration as auto created topics may have multiple partitions or be automatically configured for deletion rather than compaction</li><li><code>offset.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-offsets</code>) - topic to use for storing offsets; this topic should have many partitions, be replicated, and be configured for compaction</li><li><code>status.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-status</code>) - topic to use for storing statuses; this topic can have multiple partitions, and should be replicated and configured for compaction</li></ul><p>Note that in distributed mode the connector configurations are not passed on the command line. Instead, use the REST API described below to create, modify, and destroy connectors.</p><h2 id=configuring-connectors>Configuring Connectors<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#configuring-connectors aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Connector configurations are simple key-value mappings. For standalone mode these are defined in a properties file and passed to the Connect process on the command line. In distributed mode, they will be included in the JSON payload for the request that creates (or modifies) the connector. Most configurations are connector dependent, so they can&rsquo;t be outlined here. However, there are a few common options:</p><ul><li><code>name</code> - Unique name for the connector. Attempting to register again with the same name will fail.</li><li><code>connector.class</code> - The Java class for the connector</li><li><code>tasks.max</code> - The maximum number of tasks that should be created for this connector. The connector may create fewer tasks if it cannot achieve this level of parallelism.</li><li><code>key.converter</code> - (optional) Override the default key converter set by the worker.</li><li><code>value.converter</code> - (optional) Override the default value converter set by the worker.</li></ul><p>The <code>connector.class</code> config supports several formats: the full name or alias of the class for this connector. If the connector is org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSinkConnector, you can either specify this full name or use FileStreamSink or FileStreamSinkConnector to make the configuration a bit shorter. Sink connectors also have one additional option to control their input:</p><ul><li><code>topics</code> - A list of topics to use as input for this connector</li></ul><p>For any other options, you should consult the documentation for the connector.</p><h2 id=transformations>Transformations<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#transformations aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Connectors can be configured with transformations to make lightweight message-at-a-time modifications. They can be convenient for data massaging and event routing. A transformation chain can be specified in the connector configuration.</p><ul><li><code>transforms</code> - List of aliases for the transformation, specifying the order in which the transformations will be applied.</li><li><code>transforms.$alias.type</code> - Fully qualified class name for the transformation.</li><li><code>transforms.$alias.$transformationSpecificConfig</code> Configuration properties for the transformation</li></ul><p>For example, lets take the built-in file source connector and use a transformation to add a static field.</p><p>Throughout the example we&rsquo;ll use schemaless JSON data format. To use schemaless format, we changed the following two lines in <code>connect-standalone.properties</code> from true to false:</p><pre><code>        key.converter.schemas.enable
        value.converter.schemas.enable
</code></pre><p>The file source connector reads each line as a String. We will wrap each line in a Map and then add a second field to identify the origin of the event. To do this, we use two transformations:</p><ul><li><strong>HoistField</strong> to place the input line inside a Map</li><li><strong>InsertField</strong> to add the static field. In this example we&rsquo;ll indicate that the record came from a file connector</li></ul><p>After adding the transformations, <code>connect-file-source.properties</code> file looks as following:</p><pre><code>        name=local-file-source

</code></pre><p>All the lines starting with <code>transforms</code> were added for the transformations. You can see the two transformations we created: &ldquo;InsertSource&rdquo; and &ldquo;MakeMap&rdquo; are aliases that we chose to give the transformations. The transformation types are based on the list of built-in transformations you can see below. Each transformation type has additional configuration: HoistField requires a configuration called &ldquo;field&rdquo;, which is the name of the field in the map that will include the original String from the file. InsertField transformation lets us specify the field name and the value that we are adding.</p><p>When we ran the file source connector on my sample file without the transformations, and then read them using <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code>, the results were:</p><pre><code>        &quot;foo&quot;
        &quot;bar&quot;
        &quot;hello world&quot;
</code></pre><p>We then create a new file connector, this time after adding the transformations to the configuration file. This time, the results will be:</p><pre><code>        {&quot;line&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;data_source&quot;:&quot;test-file-source&quot;}
        {&quot;line&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;data_source&quot;:&quot;test-file-source&quot;}
        {&quot;line&quot;:&quot;hello world&quot;,&quot;data_source&quot;:&quot;test-file-source&quot;}
</code></pre><p>You can see that the lines we&rsquo;ve read are now part of a JSON map, and there is an extra field with the static value we specified. This is just one example of what you can do with transformations. Several widely-applicable data and routing transformations are included with Kafka Connect:</p><ul><li>InsertField - Add a field using either static data or record metadata</li><li>ReplaceField - Filter or rename fields</li><li>MaskField - Replace field with valid null value for the type (0, empty string, etc)</li><li>ValueToKey</li><li>HoistField - Wrap the entire event as a single field inside a Struct or a Map</li><li>ExtractField - Extract a specific field from Struct and Map and include only this field in results</li><li>SetSchemaMetadata - modify the schema name or version</li><li>TimestampRouter - Modify the topic of a record based on original topic and timestamp. Useful when using a sink that needs to write to different tables or indexes based on timestamps</li><li>RegexRouter - modify the topic of a record based on original topic, replacement string and a regular expression</li></ul><p>Details on how to configure each transformation are listed below:<div id=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField><h5>org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField</h5>Insert field(s) using attributes from the record metadata or a configured static value.<p>Use the concrete transformation type designed for the record key (<code>org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Key</code>) or value (<code>org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Value</code>).<p><table class=data-table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th><th>Default</th><th>Valid Values</th><th>Importance</th></tr><tr><td>offset.field</td><td>Field name for Kafka offset - only applicable to sink connectors.<br>Suffix with <code>!</code> to make this a required field, or <code>?</code> to keep it optional (the default).</td><td>string</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>medium</td></tr><tr><td>partition.field</td><td>Field name for Kafka partition.

By default, this service runs on port 8083. The following are the currently supported endpoints:</p><ul><li><code>GET /connectors</code> - return a list of active connectors</li><li><code>POST /connectors</code> - create a new connector; the request body should be a JSON object containing a string <code>name</code> field and an object <code>config</code> field with the connector configuration parameters</li><li><code>GET /connectors/{name}</code> - get information about a specific connector</li><li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/config</code> - get the configuration parameters for a specific connector</li><li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/config</code> - update the configuration parameters for a specific connector</li><li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/status</code> - get current status of the connector, including if it is running, failed, paused, etc., which worker it is assigned to, error information if it has failed, and the state of all its tasks</li><li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/tasks</code> - get a list of tasks currently running for a connector</li><li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/tasks/{taskid}/status</code> - get current status of the task, including if it is running, failed, paused, etc., which worker it is assigned to, and error information if it has failed</li><li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/pause</code> - pause the connector and its tasks, which stops message processing until the connector is resumed</li><li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/resume</code> - resume a paused connector (or do nothing if the connector is not paused)</li><li><code>POST /connectors/{name}/restart</code> - restart a connector (typically because it has failed)</li><li><code>POST /connectors/{name}/tasks/{taskId}/restart</code> - restart an individual task (typically because it has failed)</li><li><code>DELETE /connectors/{name}</code> - delete a connector, halting all tasks and deleting its configuration</li></ul><p>Kafka Connect also provides a REST API for getting information about connector plugins:</p><ul><li><code>GET /connector-plugins</code>- return a list of connector plugins installed in the Kafka Connect cluster.

It briefly reviews a few key concepts and then describes how to create a simple connector.</p><h2 id=core-concepts-and-apis>Core Concepts and APIs<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#core-concepts-and-apis aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><h3 id=connectors-and-tasks>Connectors and Tasks<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#connectors-and-tasks aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>To copy data between Kafka and another system, users create a <code>Connector</code> for the system they want to pull data from or push data to. Connectors come in two flavors: <code>SourceConnectors</code> import data from another system (e.g. <code>JDBCSourceConnector</code> would import a relational database into Kafka) and <code>SinkConnectors</code> export data (e.g. <code>HDFSSinkConnector</code> would export the contents of a Kafka topic to an HDFS file). <code>Connectors</code> do not perform any data copying themselves: their configuration describes the data to be copied, and the <code>Connector</code> is responsible for breaking that job into a set of <code>Tasks</code> that can be distributed to workers. These <code>Tasks</code> also come in two corresponding flavors: <code>SourceTask</code> and <code>SinkTask</code>. With an assignment in hand, each <code>Task</code> must copy its subset of the data to or from Kafka. In Kafka Connect, it should always be possible to frame these assignments as a set of input and output streams consisting of records with consistent schemas. Sometimes this mapping is obvious: each file in a set of log files can be considered a stream with each parsed line forming a record using the same schema and offsets stored as byte offsets in the file. In other cases it may require more effort to map to this model: a JDBC connector can map each table to a stream, but the offset is less clear. One possible mapping uses a timestamp column to generate queries incrementally returning new data, and the last queried timestamp can be used as the offset.</p><h3 id=streams-and-records>Streams and Records<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#streams-and-records aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Each stream should be a sequence of key-value records. Both the keys and values can have complex structure &ndash; many primitive types are provided, but arrays, objects, and nested data structures can be represented as well. The runtime data format does not assume any particular serialization format; this conversion is handled internally by the framework. In addition to the key and value, records (both those generated by sources and those delivered to sinks) have associated stream IDs and offsets. These are used by the framework to periodically commit the offsets of data that have been processed so that in the event of failures, processing can resume from the last committed offsets, avoiding unnecessary reprocessing and duplication of events.</p><h3 id=dynamic-connectors>Dynamic Connectors<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#dynamic-connectors aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Not all jobs are static, so <code>Connector</code> implementations are also responsible for monitoring the external system for any changes that might require reconfiguration. For example, in the <code>JDBCSourceConnector</code> example, the <code>Connector</code> might assign a set of tables to each <code>Task</code>. When a new table is created, it must discover this so it can assign the new table to one of the <code>Tasks</code> by updating its configuration. When it notices a change that requires reconfiguration (or a change in the number of <code>Tasks</code>), it notifies the framework and the framework updates any corresponding <code>Tasks</code>.</p><h2 id=developing-a-simple-connector>Developing a Simple Connector<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#developing-a-simple-connector aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Developing a connector only requires implementing two interfaces, the <code>Connector</code> and <code>Task</code>. A simple example is included with the source code for Kafka in the <code>file</code> package. This connector is meant for use in standalone mode and has implementations of a <code>SourceConnector</code>/<code>SourceTask</code> to read each line of a file and emit it as a record and a <code>SinkConnector</code>/<code>SinkTask</code> that writes each record to a file. The rest of this section will walk through some code to demonstrate the key steps in creating a connector, but developers should also refer to the full example source code as many details are omitted for brevity.</p><h3 id=connector-example>Connector Example<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#connector-example aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>We&rsquo;ll cover the <code>SourceConnector</code> as a simple example. <code>SinkConnector</code> implementations are very similar. Start by creating the class that inherits from <code>SourceConnector</code> and add a couple of fields that will store parsed configuration information (the filename to read from and the topic to send data to):</p><pre><code>    public class FileStreamSourceConnector extends SourceConnector {
        private String filename;
        private String topic;
</code></pre><p>The easiest method to fill in is <code>taskClass()</code>, which defines the class that should be instantiated in worker processes to actually read the data:</p><pre><code>    @Override
    public Class&lt;? extends Task&gt; taskClass() {
        return FileStreamSourceTask.class;
    }
</code></pre><p>We will define the <code>FileStreamSourceTask</code> class below. Next, we add some standard lifecycle methods, <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code>:</p><pre><code>    @Override
    public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
        // The complete version includes error handling as well.
        filename = props.get(FILE_CONFIG);
        topic = props.get(TOPIC_CONFIG);
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        // Nothing to do since no background monitoring is required.
    }
</code></pre><p>Finally, the real core of the implementation is in <code>taskConfigs()</code>. In this case we are only handling a single file, so even though we may be permitted to generate more tasks as per the <code>maxTasks</code> argument, we return a list with only one entry:</p><pre><code>    @Override
    public List&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; taskConfigs(int maxTasks) {
        ArrayList&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; configs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        // Only one input stream makes sense.
        Map&lt;String, String&gt; config = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        if (filename != null)
            config.put(FILE_CONFIG, filename);
        config.put(TOPIC_CONFIG, topic);
        configs.add(config);
        return configs;
    }
</code></pre><p>Although not used in the example, <code>SourceTask</code> also provides two APIs to commit offsets in the source system: <code>commit</code> and <code>commitRecord</code>. The APIs are provided for source systems which have an acknowledgement mechanism for messages. Overriding these methods allows the source connector to acknowledge messages in the source system, either in bulk or individually, once they have been written to Kafka. The <code>commit</code> API stores the offsets in the source system, up to the offsets that have been returned by <code>poll</code>. The implementation of this API should block until the commit is complete. The <code>commitRecord</code> API saves the offset in the source system for each <code>SourceRecord</code> after it is written to Kafka. As Kafka Connect will record offsets automatically, <code>SourceTask</code>s are not required to implement them. In cases where a connector does need to acknowledge messages in the source system, only one of the APIs is typically required. Even with multiple tasks, this method implementation is usually pretty simple. It just has to determine the number of input tasks, which may require contacting the remote service it is pulling data from, and then divvy them up. Because some patterns for splitting work among tasks are so common, some utilities are provided in <code>ConnectorUtils</code> to simplify these cases. Note that this simple example does not include dynamic input. See the discussion in the next section for how to trigger updates to task configs.</p><h3 id=task-example---source-task>Task Example - Source Task<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#task-example---source-task aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Next we&rsquo;ll describe the implementation of the corresponding <code>SourceTask</code>. The implementation is short, but too long to cover completely in this guide. We&rsquo;ll use pseudo-code to describe most of the implementation, but you can refer to the source code for the full example. Just as with the connector, we need to create a class inheriting from the appropriate base <code>Task</code> class. It also has some standard lifecycle methods:</p><pre><code>    public class FileStreamSourceTask extends SourceTask {
        String filename;
        InputStream stream;
        String topic;

        @Override
        public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
            filename = props.get(FileStreamSourceConnector.FILE_CONFIG);
            stream = openOrThrowError(filename);
            topic = props.get(FileStreamSourceConnector.TOPIC_CONFIG);
        }

        @Override
        public synchronized void stop() {
            stream.close();
        }
</code></pre><p>These are slightly simplified versions, but show that that these methods should be relatively simple and the only work they should perform is allocating or freeing resources. There are two points to note about this implementation. First, the <code>start()</code> method does not yet handle resuming from a previous offset, which will be addressed in a later section. Second, the <code>stop()</code> method is synchronized. This will be necessary because <code>SourceTasks</code> are given a dedicated thread which they can block indefinitely, so they need to be stopped with a call from a different thread in the Worker. Next, we implement the main functionality of the task, the <code>poll()</code> method which gets events from the input system and returns a <code>List&lt;SourceRecord></code>:</p><pre><code>    @Override
    public List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; poll() throws InterruptedException {
        try {
            ArrayList&lt;SourceRecord&gt; records = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
            while (streamValid(stream) &amp;&amp; records.isEmpty()) {
                LineAndOffset line = readToNextLine(stream);
                if (line != null) {
                    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; sourcePartition = Collections.singletonMap(&quot;filename&quot;, filename);
                    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; sourceOffset = Collections.singletonMap(&quot;position&quot;, streamOffset);
                    records.add(new SourceRecord(sourcePartition, sourceOffset, topic, Schema.STRING_SCHEMA, line));
                } else {
                    Thread.sleep(1);
                }
            }
            return records;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Underlying stream was killed, probably as a result of calling stop. Allow to return
            // null, and driving thread will handle any shutdown if necessary.
        }
        return null;
    }
</code></pre><p>Again, we&rsquo;ve omitted some details, but we can see the important steps: the <code>poll()</code> method is going to be called repeatedly, and for each call it will loop trying to read records from the file. For each line it reads, it also tracks the file offset. It uses this information to create an output <code>SourceRecord</code> with four pieces of information: the source partition (there is only one, the single file being read), source offset (byte offset in the file), output topic name, and output value (the line, and we include a schema indicating this value will always be a string). Other variants of the <code>SourceRecord</code> constructor can also include a specific output partition and a key. Note that this implementation uses the normal Java <code>InputStream</code> interface and may sleep if data is not available. This is acceptable because Kafka Connect provides each task with a dedicated thread. While task implementations have to conform to the basic <code>poll()</code> interface, they have a lot of flexibility in how they are implemented. In this case, an NIO-based implementation would be more efficient, but this simple approach works, is quick to implement, and is compatible with older versions of Java.</p><h3 id=sink-tasks>Sink Tasks<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#sink-tasks aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The previous section described how to implement a simple <code>SourceTask</code>. Unlike <code>SourceConnector</code> and <code>SinkConnector</code>, <code>SourceTask</code> and <code>SinkTask</code> have very different interfaces because <code>SourceTask</code> uses a pull interface and <code>SinkTask</code> uses a push interface. Both share the common lifecycle methods, but the <code>SinkTask</code> interface is quite different:</p><pre><code>    public abstract class SinkTask implements Task {
        public void initialize(SinkTaskContext context) {
            this.context = context;
        }

        public abstract void put(Collection&lt;SinkRecord&gt; records);

        public void flush(Map&lt;TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata&gt; currentOffsets) {
        }
</code></pre><p>The <code>SinkTask</code> documentation contains full details, but this interface is nearly as simple as the <code>SourceTask</code>. The <code>put()</code> method should contain most of the implementation, accepting sets of <code>SinkRecords</code>, performing any required translation, and storing them in the destination system. This method does not need to ensure the data has been fully written to the destination system before returning. In fact, in many cases internal buffering will be useful so an entire batch of records can be sent at once, reducing the overhead of inserting events into the downstream data store. The <code>SinkRecords</code> contain essentially the same information as <code>SourceRecords</code>: Kafka topic, partition, offset and the event key and value. The <code>flush()</code> method is used during the offset commit process, which allows tasks to recover from failures and resume from a safe point such that no events will be missed. The method should push any outstanding data to the destination system and then block until the write has been acknowledged. The <code>offsets</code> parameter can often be ignored, but is useful in some cases where implementations want to store offset information in the destination store to provide exactly-once delivery. For example, an HDFS connector could do this and use atomic move operations to make sure the <code>flush()</code> operation atomically commits the data and offsets to a final location in HDFS.</p><h3 id=resuming-from-previous-offsets>Resuming from Previous Offsets<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#resuming-from-previous-offsets aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The <code>SourceTask</code> implementation included a stream ID (the input filename) and offset (position in the file) with each record. The framework uses this to commit offsets periodically so that in the case of a failure, the task can recover and minimize the number of events that are reprocessed and possibly duplicated (or to resume from the most recent offset if Kafka Connect was stopped gracefully, e.g. in standalone mode or due to a job reconfiguration). This commit process is completely automated by the framework, but only the connector knows how to seek back to the right position in the input stream to resume from that location. To correctly resume upon startup, the task can use the <code>SourceContext</code> passed into its <code>initialize()</code> method to access the offset data. In <code>initialize()</code>, we would add a bit more code to read the offset (if it exists) and seek to that position:</p><pre><code>        stream = new FileInputStream(filename);
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; offset = context.offsetStorageReader().offset(Collections.singletonMap(FILENAME_FIELD, filename));
        if (offset != null) {
            Long lastRecordedOffset = (Long) offset.get(&quot;position&quot;);
            if (lastRecordedOffset != null)
                seekToOffset(stream, lastRecordedOffset);
        }
</code></pre><p>Of course, you might need to read many keys for each of the input streams. The <code>OffsetStorageReader</code> interface also allows you to issue bulk reads to efficiently load all offsets, then apply them by seeking each input stream to the appropriate position.</p><h2 id=dynamic-inputoutput-streams>Dynamic Input/Output Streams<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#dynamic-inputoutput-streams aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka Connect is intended to define bulk data copying jobs, such as copying an entire database rather than creating many jobs to copy each table individually. One consequence of this design is that the set of input or output streams for a connector can vary over time. Source connectors need to monitor the source system for changes, e.g. table additions/deletions in a database. When they pick up changes, they should notify the framework via the <code>ConnectorContext</code> object that reconfiguration is necessary. For example, in a <code>SourceConnector</code>:</p><pre><code>        if (inputsChanged())
            this.context.requestTaskReconfiguration();
</code></pre><p>The framework will promptly request new configuration information and update the tasks, allowing them to gracefully commit their progress before reconfiguring them. Note that in the <code>SourceConnector</code> this monitoring is currently left up to the connector implementation. If an extra thread is required to perform this monitoring, the connector must allocate it itself. Ideally this code for monitoring changes would be isolated to the <code>Connector</code> and tasks would not need to worry about them. However, changes can also affect tasks, most commonly when one of their input streams is destroyed in the input system, e.g. if a table is dropped from a database. If the <code>Task</code> encounters the issue before the <code>Connector</code>, which will be common if the <code>Connector</code> needs to poll for changes, the <code>Task</code> will need to handle the subsequent error. Thankfully, this can usually be handled simply by catching and handling the appropriate exception. <code>SinkConnectors</code> usually only have to handle the addition of streams, which may translate to new entries in their outputs (e.g., a new database table). The framework manages any changes to the Kafka input, such as when the set of input topics changes because of a regex subscription. <code>SinkTasks</code> should expect new input streams, which may require creating new resources in the downstream system, such as a new table in a database. The trickiest situation to handle in these cases may be conflicts between multiple <code>SinkTasks</code> seeing a new input stream for the first time and simultaneously trying to create the new resource. <code>SinkConnectors</code>, on the other hand, will generally require no special code for handling a dynamic set of streams.</p><h2 id=connect-configuration-validation>Connect Configuration Validation<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#connect-configuration-validation aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka Connect allows you to validate connector configurations before submitting a connector to be executed and can provide feedback about errors and recommended values. To take advantage of this, connector developers need to provide an implementation of <code>config()</code> to expose the configuration definition to the framework. The following code in <code>FileStreamSourceConnector</code> defines the configuration and exposes it to the framework.</p><pre><code>        private static final ConfigDef CONFIG_DEF = new ConfigDef()
            .define(FILE_CONFIG, Type.STRING, Importance.HIGH, &quot;Source filename.&quot;)
            .define(TOPIC_CONFIG, Type.STRING, Importance.HIGH, &quot;The topic to publish data to&quot;);

        public ConfigDef config() {
            return CONFIG_DEF;
        }
</code></pre><p><code>ConfigDef</code> class is used for specifying the set of expected configurations. For each configuration, you can specify the name, the type, the default value, the documentation, the group information, the order in the group, the width of the configuration value and the name suitable for display in the UI. Plus, you can provide special validation logic used for single configuration validation by overriding the <code>Validator</code> class. Moreover, as there may be dependencies between configurations, for example, the valid values and visibility of a configuration may change according to the values of other configurations. To handle this, <code>ConfigDef</code> allows you to specify the dependents of a configuration and to provide an implementation of <code>Recommender</code> to get valid values and set visibility of a configuration given the current configuration values. Also, the <code>validate()</code> method in <code>Connector</code> provides a default validation implementation which returns a list of allowed configurations together with configuration errors and recommended values for each configuration. However, it does not use the recommended values for configuration validation. You may provide an override of the default implementation for customized configuration validation, which may use the recommended values.</p><h2 id=working-with-schemas>Working with Schemas<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#working-with-schemas aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The FileStream connectors are good examples because they are simple, but they also have trivially structured data &ndash; each line is just a string. Almost all practical connectors will need schemas with more complex data formats. To create more complex data, you&rsquo;ll need to work with the Kafka Connect <code>data</code> API. Most structured records will need to interact with two classes in addition to primitive types: <code>Schema</code> and <code>Struct</code>. The API documentation provides a complete reference, but here is a simple example creating a <code>Schema</code> and <code>Struct</code>:</p><pre><code>    Schema schema = SchemaBuilder.struct().name(NAME)
        .field(&quot;name&quot;, Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
        .field(&quot;age&quot;, Schema.INT_SCHEMA)
        .field(&quot;admin&quot;, new SchemaBuilder.boolean().defaultValue(false).build())
        .build();

    Struct struct = new Struct(schema)
        .put(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Barbara Liskov&quot;)
        .put(&quot;age&quot;, 75);
</code></pre><p>If you are implementing a source connector, you&rsquo;ll need to decide when and how to create schemas. Where possible, you should avoid recomputing them as much as possible. For example, if your connector is guaranteed to have a fixed schema, create it statically and reuse a single instance. However, many connectors will have dynamic schemas. One simple example of this is a database connector. Considering even just a single table, the schema will not be predefined for the entire connector (as it varies from table to table). But it also may not be fixed for a single table over the lifetime of the connector since the user may execute an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> command. The connector must be able to detect these changes and react appropriately. Sink connectors are usually simpler because they are consuming data and therefore do not need to create schemas. However, they should take just as much care to validate that the schemas they receive have the expected format. When the schema does not match &ndash; usually indicating the upstream producer is generating invalid data that cannot be correctly translated to the destination system &ndash; sink connectors should throw an exception to indicate this error to the system.</p><h2 id=kafka-connect-administration>Kafka Connect Administration<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-connect-administration aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Kafka Connect&rsquo;s REST layer provides a set of APIs to enable administration of the cluster. This includes APIs to view the configuration of connectors and the status of their tasks, as well as to alter their current behavior (e.g. changing configuration and restarting tasks).</p><p>When a connector is first submitted to the cluster, the workers rebalance the full set of connectors in the cluster and their tasks so that each worker has approximately the same amount of work. This same rebalancing procedure is also used when connectors increase or decrease the number of tasks they require, or when a connector&rsquo;s configuration is changed. You can use the REST API to view the current status of a connector and its tasks, including the id of the worker to which each was assigned. For example, querying the status of a file source (using <code>GET /connectors/file-source/status</code>) might produce output like the following:</p><pre><code>    {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;file-source&quot;,
    &quot;connector&quot;: {
        &quot;state&quot;: &quot;RUNNING&quot;,
        &quot;worker_id&quot;: &quot;192.168.1.208:8083&quot;
    },
    &quot;tasks&quot;: [
        {
        &quot;id&quot;: 0,
        &quot;state&quot;: &quot;RUNNING&quot;,
        &quot;worker_id&quot;: &quot;192.168.1.209:8083&quot;
        }
    ]
    }
</code></pre><p>Connectors and their tasks publish status updates to a shared topic (configured with <code>status.storage.topic</code>) which all workers in the cluster monitor. Because the workers consume this topic asynchronously, there is typically a (short) delay before a state change is visible through the status API. The following states are possible for a connector or one of its tasks:</p><ul><li><strong>UNASSIGNED:</strong> The connector/task has not yet been assigned to a worker.</li><li><strong>RUNNING:</strong> The connector/task is running.</li><li><strong>PAUSED:</strong> The connector/task has been administratively paused.</li><li><strong>FAILED:</strong> The connector/task has failed (usually by raising an exception, which is reported in the status output).</li></ul><p>In most cases, connector and task states will match, though they may be different for short periods of time when changes are occurring or if tasks have failed. For example, when a connector is first started, there may be a noticeable delay before the connector and its tasks have all transitioned to the RUNNING state. States will also diverge when tasks fail since Connect does not automatically restart failed tasks. To restart a connector/task manually, you can use the restart APIs listed above. Note that if you try to restart a task while a rebalance is taking place, Connect will return a 409 (Conflict) status code. You can retry after the rebalance completes, but it might not be necessary since rebalances effectively restart all the connectors and tasks in the cluster.</p><p>It&rsquo;s sometimes useful to temporarily stop the message processing of a connector. For example, if the remote system is undergoing maintenance, it would be preferable for source connectors to stop polling it for new data instead of filling logs with exception spam. For this use case, Connect offers a pause/resume API. While a source connector is paused, Connect will stop polling it for additional records. While a sink connector is paused, Connect will stop pushing new messages to it. The pause state is persistent, so even if you restart the cluster, the connector will not begin message processing again until the task has been resumed. Note that there may be a delay before all of a connector&rsquo;s tasks have transitioned to the PAUSED state since it may take time for them to finish whatever processing they were in the middle of when being paused. Additionally, failed tasks will not transition to the PAUSED state until they have been restarted.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-610f9aef7b075660fa13dbf6f9f32603>9 - Kafka Streams</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-542e63d10060f97632b83501d96b983d>9.1 - Introduction</h1><h1 id=kafka-streams-api>Kafka Streams API<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#kafka-streams-api aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h1 id=the-easiest-way-to-write-mission-critical-real-time-applications-and-microservices-with-all-the-benefits-of-kafkas-server-side-cluster-technology>The easiest way to write mission-critical real-time applications and microservices with all the benefits of Kafka&rsquo;s server-side cluster technology.<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-easiest-way-to-write-mission-critical-real-time-applications-and-microservices-with-all-the-benefits-of-kafkas-server-side-cluster-technology aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-welcome.png></p><p><a href=/0110/streams/tutorial/>Write your first app</a> <a href=/0110/streams/quickstart/>Play with demo app</a></p><ul><li>Write standard Java applications</li><li>Exactly-once processing semantics</li><li>No seperate processing cluster required</li><li>Develop on Mac, Linux, Windows</li><li>Elastic, highly scalable, fault-tolerant</li><li>Deploy to containers, VMs, bare metal, cloud</li><li>Equally viable for small, medium, & large use cases</li><li>Fully integrated with Kafka security</li></ul><p><a href=/0110/documentation/streams/developer-guide><img src=/0110/images/icons/documentation.png> <img src=/0110/images/icons/documentation--white.png> Developer manual </a><a href=/0110/documentation/streams/tutorial><img src=/0110/images/icons/tutorials.png> <img src=/0110/images/icons/tutorials--white.png> Tutorials </a><a href=/0110/documentation/streams/core-concepts><img src=/0110/images/icons/architecture.png> <img src=/0110/images/icons/architecture--white.png> Concepts</a></p><h1 id=hello-kafka-streams>Hello Kafka Streams<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#hello-kafka-streams aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>The code example below implements a WordCount application that is elastic, highly scalable, fault-tolerant, stateful, and ready to run in production at large scale</p><p>Java 8+ Java 7 Scala</p><pre><code>                import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;

Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka&rsquo;s server-side cluster technology to make these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed, and much more.</p><p>This quickstart example will demonstrate how to run a streaming application coded in this library. Here is the gist of the <code>[WordCountDemo](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0.11.0/streams/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/examples/wordcount/WordCountDemo.java)</code> example code (converted to use Java 8 lambda expressions for easy reading).</p><pre><code>// Serializers/deserializers (serde) for String and Long types
final Serde&lt;String&gt; stringSerde = Serdes.String();
final Serde&lt;Long&gt; longSerde = Serdes.Long();

// Construct a `KStream` from the input topic &quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;, where message values
// represent lines of text (for the sake of this example, we ignore whatever may be stored
// in the message keys).
KStream&lt;String, String&gt; textLines = builder.stream(stringSerde, stringSerde, &quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;);

KTable&lt;String, Long&gt; wordCounts = textLines
    // Split each text line, by whitespace, into words.
    .flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split(&quot;\W+&quot;)))

    // Group the text words as message keys
    .groupBy((key, value) -&gt; value)

    // Count the occurrences of each word (message key).
    .count(&quot;Counts&quot;)

// Store the running counts as a changelog stream to the output topic.
wordCounts.to(stringSerde, longSerde, &quot;streams-wordcount-output&quot;);
</code></pre><p>It implements the WordCount algorithm, which computes a word occurrence histogram from the input text. However, unlike other WordCount examples you might have seen before that operate on bounded data, the WordCount demo application behaves slightly differently because it is designed to operate on an <strong>infinite, unbounded stream</strong> of data. Similar to the bounded variant, it is a stateful algorithm that tracks and updates the counts of words. However, since it must assume potentially unbounded input data, it will periodically output its current state and results while continuing to process more data because it cannot know when it has processed &ldquo;all&rdquo; the input data.</p><p>As the first step, we will start Kafka (unless you already have it started) and then we will prepare input data to a Kafka topic, which will subsequently be processed by a Kafka Streams application.</p><h2 id=step-1-download-the-code>Step 1: Download the code<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-1-download-the-code aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p><a href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/0.11.0.2/kafka_2.11-0.11.0.2.tgz" title="Kafka downloads">Download</a> the 0.11.0.2 release and un-tar it.

</code></pre><p>The demo application will read from the input topic <strong>streams-plaintext-input</strong> , perform the computations of the WordCount algorithm on each of the read messages, and continuously write its current results to the output topic <strong>streams-wordcount-output</strong>. Hence there won&rsquo;t be any STDOUT output except log entries as the results are written back into in Kafka.</p><p>Now we can start the console producer in a separate terminal to write some input data to this topic:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic streams-plaintext-input
</code></pre><p>and inspect the output of the WordCount demo application by reading from its output topic with the console consumer in a separate terminal:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \

</code></pre><h2 id=step-5-process-some-data>Step 5: Process some data<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-5-process-some-data aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Now let&rsquo;s write some message with the console producer into the input topic <strong>streams-plaintext-input</strong> by entering a single line of text and then hit <return>. This will send a new message to the input topic, where the message key is null and the message value is the string encoded text line that you just entered (in practice, input data for applications will typically be streaming continuously into Kafka, rather than being manually entered as we do in this quickstart):</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic streams-plaintext-input
all streams lead to kafka
</code></pre><p>This message will be processed by the Wordcount application and the following output data will be written to the <strong>streams-wordcount-output</strong> topic and printed by the console consumer:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

</code></pre><p>Here, the first column is the Kafka message key in <code>java.lang.String</code> format and represents a word that is being counted, and the second column is the message value in <code>java.lang.Long</code>format, representing the word&rsquo;s latest count.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s continue writing one more message with the console producer into the input topic <strong>streams-plaintext-input</strong>. Enter the text line &ldquo;hello kafka streams&rdquo; and hit <return>. Your terminal should look as follows:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic streams-plaintext-input
all streams lead to kafka
hello kafka streams
</code></pre><p>In your other terminal in which the console consumer is running, you will observe that the WordCount application wrote new output data:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    --topic streams-wordcount-output \
    --from-beginning \
    --formatter kafka.tools.DefaultMessageFormatter \

</code></pre><p>Here the last printed lines <strong>kafka 2</strong> and <strong>streams 2</strong> indicate updates to the keys <strong>kafka</strong> and <strong>streams</strong> whose counts have been incremented from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>2</strong>. Whenever you write further input messages to the input topic, you will observe new messages being added to the <strong>streams-wordcount-output</strong> topic, representing the most recent word counts as computed by the WordCount application. Let&rsquo;s enter one final input text line &ldquo;join kafka summit&rdquo; and hit <return>in the console producer to the input topic <strong>streams-wordcount-input</strong> before we wrap up this quickstart:</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic streams-wordcount-input
all streams lead to kafka

</code></pre><p>The <strong>streams-wordcount-output</strong> topic will subsequently show the corresponding updated word counts (see last three lines):</p><pre><code>&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

</code></pre><p>As one can see, outputs of the Wordcount application is actually a continuous stream of updates, where each output record (i.e. each line in the original output above) is an updated count of a single word, aka record key such as &ldquo;kafka&rdquo;. For multiple records with the same key, each later record is an update of the previous one.</p><p>The two diagrams below illustrate what is essentially happening behind the scenes. The first column shows the evolution of the current state of the <code>KTable&lt;String, Long></code> that is counting word occurrences for <code>count</code>. The second column shows the change records that result from state updates to the KTable and that are being sent to the output Kafka topic <strong>streams-wordcount-output</strong>.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-table-updates-02.png> <img src=/0110/images/streams-table-updates-01.png></p><p>First the text line &ldquo;all streams lead to kafka&rdquo; is being processed. The <code>KTable</code> is being built up as each new word results in a new table entry (highlighted with a green background), and a corresponding change record is sent to the downstream <code>KStream</code>.</p><p>When the second text line &ldquo;hello kafka streams&rdquo; is processed, we observe, for the first time, that existing entries in the <code>KTable</code> are being updated (here: for the words &ldquo;kafka&rdquo; and for &ldquo;streams&rdquo;). And again, change records are being sent to the output topic.</p><p>And so on (we skip the illustration of how the third line is being processed). This explains why the output topic has the contents we showed above, because it contains the full record of changes.</p><p>Looking beyond the scope of this concrete example, what Kafka Streams is doing here is to leverage the duality between a table and a changelog stream (here: table = the KTable, changelog stream = the downstream KStream): you can publish every change of the table to a stream, and if you consume the entire changelog stream from beginning to end, you can reconstruct the contents of the table.</p><h2 id=step-6-teardown-the-application>Step 6: Teardown the application<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#step-6-teardown-the-application aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You can now stop the console consumer, the console producer, the Wordcount application, the Kafka broker and the Zookeeper server in order via <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>.</p><p><a href=/0110/streams/>Previous</a> <a href=/0110/streams/tutorial/>Next</a></p><ul><li><a href=/documentation>Documentation</a></li><li><a href=/streams>Streams</a></li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-249854baba8b3d63d0ee2ec703e4d33d>9.3 - Write a streams app</h1><h1 id=write-your-own-streams-applications>Write your own Streams Applications<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#write-your-own-streams-applications aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>In this guide we will start from scratch on setting up your own project to write a stream processing application using Kafka&rsquo;s Streams API.

            -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.kafka \
            -DarchetypeArtifactId=streams-quickstart-java \
            -DarchetypeVersion=0.11.0.2 \
            -DgroupId=streams.examples \
            -DartifactId=streams.examples \
            -Dversion=0.1 \
            -Dpackage=myapps
</code></pre><p>You can use a different value for <code>groupId</code>, <code>artifactId</code> and <code>package</code> parameters if you like. Assuming the above parameter values are used, this command will create a project structure that looks like this:</p><pre><code>        &gt; tree streams.examples
        streams-quickstart
        |-- pom.xml
        |-- src

</code></pre><p>There are already several example programs written with Streams library under <code>src/main/java</code>. Since we are going to start writing such programs from scratch, we can now delete these examples:</p><pre><code>        &gt; cd streams-quickstart
        &gt; rm src/main/java/myapps/*.java
</code></pre><h2 id=writing-a-first-streams-application-pipe>Writing a first Streams application: Pipe<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#writing-a-first-streams-application-pipe aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s coding time now! Feel free to open your favorite IDE and import this Maven project, or simply open a text editor and create a java file under <code>src/main/java</code>. Let&rsquo;s name it <code>Pipe.java</code>:</p><pre><code>        package myapps;

        public class Pipe {

            public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

            }
        }
</code></pre><p>We are going to fill in the <code>main</code> function to write this pipe program. Note that we will not list the import statements as we go since IDEs can usually add them automatically. However if you are using a text editor you need to manually add the imports, and at the end of this section we&rsquo;ll show the complete code snippet with import statement for you.</p><p>The first step to write a Streams application is to create a <code>java.util.Properties</code> map to specify different Streams execution configuration values as defined in <code>StreamsConfig</code>. A couple of important configuration values you need to set are: <code>StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG</code>, which specifies a list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster, and <code>StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG</code>, which gives the unique identifier of your Streams application to distinguish itself with other applications talking to the same Kafka cluster:</p><pre><code>        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, &quot;streams-pipe&quot;);
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);    // assuming that the Kafka broker this application is talking to runs on local machine with port 9092
</code></pre><p>In addition, you can customize other configurations in the same map, for example, default serialization and deserialization libraries for the record key-value pairs:</p><pre><code>        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
</code></pre><p>For a full list of configurations of Kafka Streams please refer to this <a href=/0110/#streamsconfigs>table</a>.</p><p>Next we will define the computational logic of our Streams application. In Kafka Streams this computational logic is defined as a <code>topology</code> of connected processor nodes. We can use a topology builder to construct such a topology,</p><pre><code>        final KStreamBuilder builder = new KStreamBuilder();
</code></pre><p>And then create a source stream from a Kafka topic named <code>streams-plaintext-input</code> using this topology builder:</p><pre><code>        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; source = builder.stream(&quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Now we get a <code>KStream</code> that is continuously generating records from its source Kafka topic <code>streams-plaintext-input</code>. The records are organized as <code>String</code> typed key-value pairs. The simplest thing we can do with this stream is to write it into another Kafka topic, say it&rsquo;s named <code>streams-pipe-output</code>:</p><pre><code>        source.to(&quot;streams-pipe-output&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Note that we can also concatenate the above two lines into a single line as:</p><pre><code>        builder.stream(&quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;).to(&quot;streams-pipe-output&quot;);
</code></pre><p>we can now construct the Streams client with the two components we have just constructed above: the configuration map and the topology builder object (one can also construct a <code>StreamsConfig</code> object from the <code>props</code> map and then pass that object to the constructor, <code>KafkaStreams</code> have overloaded constructor functions to takes either type).</p><pre><code>        final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder, props);
</code></pre><p>By calling its <code>start()</code> function we can trigger the execution of this client. The execution won&rsquo;t stop until <code>close()</code> is called on this client. We can, for example, add a shutdown hook with a countdown latch to capture a user interrupt and close the client upon terminating this program:</p><pre><code>        final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

        // attach shutdown handler to catch control-c
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(&quot;streams-shutdown-hook&quot;) {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                streams.close();
                latch.countDown();
            }
        });

        try {
            streams.start();
            latch.await();
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            System.exit(1);
        }
        System.exit(0);

</code></pre><p>Since each of the source stream&rsquo;s record is a <code>String</code> typed key-value pair, let&rsquo;s treat the value string as a text line and split it into words with a <code>FlatMapValues</code> operator:</p><pre><code>        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; source = builder.stream(&quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;);
        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; words = builder.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper&lt;String, Iterable&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {
                    @Override
                    public Iterable&lt;String&gt; apply(String value) {
                        return Arrays.asList(value.split(&quot;\W+&quot;));
                    }
                });
</code></pre><p>The operator will take the <code>source</code> stream as its input, and generate a new stream named <code>words</code> by processing each record from its source stream in order and breaking its value string into a list of words, and producing each word as a new record to the output <code>words</code> stream. This is a stateless operator that does not need to keep track of any previously received records or processed results. Note if you are using JDK 8 you can use lambda expression and simplify the above code as:</p><pre><code>        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; source = builder.stream(&quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;);
        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; words = source.flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.split(&quot;\W+&quot;)));
</code></pre><p>And finally we can write the word stream back into another Kafka topic, say <code>streams-linesplit-output</code>. Again, these two steps can be concatenated as the following (assuming lambda expression is used):</p><pre><code>        KStream&lt;String, String&gt; source = builder.stream(&quot;streams-plaintext-input&quot;);
        source.flatMapValues(value -&gt; Arrays.asList(value.split(&quot;\W+&quot;)))
              .to(&quot;streams-linesplit-output&quot;);

Following similar steps let&rsquo;s create another program based on the <code>LineSplit.java</code> class:</p><pre><code>        public class WordCount {

            public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                Properties props = new Properties();
                props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, &quot;streams-wordcount&quot;);
                // ...
            }
        }
</code></pre><p>In order to count the words we can first modify the <code>flatMapValues</code> operator to treat all of them as lower case (assuming lambda expression is used):</p><pre><code>        source.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper&lt;String, Iterable&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {
                    @Override

                    }
                });
</code></pre><p>In order to do the counting aggregation we have to first specify that we want to key the stream on the value string, i.e. the lower cased word, with a <code>groupBy</code> operator. This operator generate a new grouped stream, which can then be aggregated by a <code>count</code> operator, which generates a running count on each of the grouped keys:</p><pre><code>        KTable&lt;String, Long&gt; counts =
        source.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper&lt;String, Iterable&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {

              .count(&quot;Counts&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Note that the <code>count</code> operator has a <code>String</code> typed parameter <code>Counts</code>, which stores the running counts that keep being updated as more records are piped and processed from the source Kafka topic. This <code>Counts</code> store can be queried in real-time, with details described in the <a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/#streams_interactive_queries>Developer Manual</a>.</p><p>We can also write the <code>counts</code> KTable&rsquo;s changelog stream back into another Kafka topic, say <code>streams-wordcount-output</code>. Note that this time the value type is no longer <code>String</code> but <code>Long</code>, so the default serialization classes are not viable for writing it to Kafka anymore. We need to provide overridden serialization methods for <code>Long</code> types, otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown:</p><pre><code>        counts.to(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long(), &quot;streams-wordcount-output&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Note that in order to read the changelog stream from topic <code>streams-wordcount-output</code>, one needs to set the value deserialization as <code>org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongDeserializer</code>.

It builds upon important stream processing concepts such as properly distinguishing between event time and processing time, windowing support, and simple yet efficient management of application state.</p><p>Kafka Streams has a <strong>low barrier to entry</strong> : You can quickly write and run a small-scale proof-of-concept on a single machine; and you only need to run additional instances of your application on multiple machines to scale up to high-volume production workloads. Kafka Streams transparently handles the load balancing of multiple instances of the same application by leveraging Kafka&rsquo;s parallelism model.</p><p>Some highlights of Kafka Streams:</p><ul><li>Designed as a <strong>simple and lightweight client library</strong> , which can be easily embedded in any Java application and integrated with any existing packaging, deployment and operational tools that users have for their streaming applications.</li><li>Has <strong>no external dependencies on systems other than Apache Kafka itself</strong> as the internal messaging layer; notably, it uses Kafka&rsquo;s partitioning model to horizontally scale processing while maintaining strong ordering guarantees.</li><li>Supports <strong>fault-tolerant local state</strong> , which enables very fast and efficient stateful operations like windowed joins and aggregations.</li><li>Supports <strong>exactly-once</strong> processing semantics to guarantee that each record will be processed once and only once even when there is a failure on either Streams clients or Kafka brokers in the middle of processing.</li><li>Employs <strong>one-record-at-a-time processing</strong> to achieve millisecond processing latency, and supports <strong>event-time based windowing operations</strong> with late arrival of records.</li><li>Offers necessary stream processing primitives, along with a <strong>high-level Streams DSL</strong> and a <strong>low-level Processor API</strong>.</li></ul><p>We first summarize the key concepts of Kafka Streams.</p><h1 id=stream-processing-topology>Stream Processing Topology<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#stream-processing-topology aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><ul><li>A <strong>stream</strong> is the most important abstraction provided by Kafka Streams: it represents an unbounded, continuously updating data set. A stream is an ordered, replayable, and fault-tolerant sequence of immutable data records, where a <strong>data record</strong> is defined as a key-value pair.</li><li>A <strong>stream processing application</strong> is any program that makes use of the Kafka Streams library. It defines its computational logic through one or more <strong>processor topologies</strong> , where a processor topology is a graph of stream processors (nodes) that are connected by streams (edges).</li><li>A <strong>stream processor</strong> is a node in the processor topology; it represents a processing step to transform data in streams by receiving one input record at a time from its upstream processors in the topology, applying its operation to it, and may subsequently produce one or more output records to its downstream processors.</li></ul><p>There are two special processors in the topology:</p><ul><li><strong>Source Processor</strong> : A source processor is a special type of stream processor that does not have any upstream processors. It produces an input stream to its topology from one or multiple Kafka topics by consuming records from these topics and forward them to its down-stream processors.</li><li><strong>Sink Processor</strong> : A sink processor is a special type of stream processor that does not have down-stream processors. It sends any received records from its up-stream processors to a specified Kafka topic.</li></ul><p>Note that in normal processor nodes other remote systems can also be accessed while processing the current record. Therefore the processed results can either be streamed back into Kafka or written to an external system. <img src=/0110/images/streams-architecture-topology.jpg></p><p>Kafka Streams offers two ways to define the stream processing topology: the <a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/#streams_dsl><strong>Kafka Streams DSL</strong></a> provides the most common data transformation operations such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>join</code> and <code>aggregations</code> out of the box; the lower-level <a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/#streams_processor><strong>Processor API</strong></a> allows developers define and connect custom processors as well as to interact with state stores.</p><p>A processor topology is merely a logical abstraction for your stream processing code. At runtime, the logical topology is instantiated and replicated inside the application for parallel processing (see <strong>Stream Partitions and Tasks</strong> for details).</p><h1 id=time>Time<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#time aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>A critical aspect in stream processing is the notion of <strong>time</strong> , and how it is modeled and integrated. For example, some operations such as <strong>windowing</strong> are defined based on time boundaries.</p><p>Common notions of time in streams are:</p><ul><li><strong>Event time</strong> - The point in time when an event or data record occurred, i.e. was originally created &ldquo;at the source&rdquo;. <strong>Example:</strong> If the event is a geo-location change reported by a GPS sensor in a car, then the associated event-time would be the time when the GPS sensor captured the location change.</li><li><strong>Processing time</strong> - The point in time when the event or data record happens to be processed by the stream processing application, i.e. when the record is being consumed. The processing time may be milliseconds, hours, or days etc. later than the original event time. <strong>Example:</strong> Imagine an analytics application that reads and processes the geo-location data reported from car sensors to present it to a fleet management dashboard. Here, processing-time in the analytics application might be milliseconds or seconds (e.g. for real-time pipelines based on Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams) or hours (e.g. for batch pipelines based on Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark) after event-time.</li><li><strong>Ingestion time</strong> - The point in time when an event or data record is stored in a topic partition by a Kafka broker. The difference to event time is that this ingestion timestamp is generated when the record is appended to the target topic by the Kafka broker, not when the record is created &ldquo;at the source&rdquo;. The difference to processing time is that processing time is when the stream processing application processes the record. <strong>For example,</strong> if a record is never processed, there is no notion of processing time for it, but it still has an ingestion time.</li></ul><p>The choice between event-time and ingestion-time is actually done through the configuration of Kafka (not Kafka Streams): From Kafka 0.10.x onwards, timestamps are automatically embedded into Kafka messages. Depending on Kafka&rsquo;s configuration these timestamps represent event-time or ingestion-time. The respective Kafka configuration setting can be specified on the broker level or per topic. The default timestamp extractor in Kafka Streams will retrieve these embedded timestamps as-is. Hence, the effective time semantics of your application depend on the effective Kafka configuration for these embedded timestamps.</p><p>Kafka Streams assigns a <strong>timestamp</strong> to every data record via the <code>TimestampExtractor</code> interface. Concrete implementations of this interface may retrieve or compute timestamps based on the actual contents of data records such as an embedded timestamp field to provide event-time semantics, or use any other approach such as returning the current wall-clock time at the time of processing, thereby yielding processing-time semantics to stream processing applications. Developers can thus enforce different notions of time depending on their business needs. For example, per-record timestamps describe the progress of a stream with regards to time (although records may be out-of-order within the stream) and are leveraged by time-dependent operations such as joins.</p><p>Finally, whenever a Kafka Streams application writes records to Kafka, then it will also assign timestamps to these new records. The way the timestamps are assigned depends on the context:</p><ul><li>When new output records are generated via processing some input record, for example, <code>context.forward()</code> triggered in the <code>process()</code> function call, output record timestamps are inherited from input record timestamps directly.</li><li>When new output records are generated via periodic functions such as <code>punctuate()</code>, the output record timestamp is defined as the current internal time (obtained through <code>context.timestamp()</code>) of the stream task.</li><li>For aggregations, the timestamp of a resulting aggregate update record will be that of the latest arrived input record that triggered the update.</li></ul><h1 id=states>States<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#states aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Some stream processing applications don&rsquo;t require state, which means the processing of a message is independent from the processing of all other messages. However, being able to maintain state opens up many possibilities for sophisticated stream processing applications: you can join input streams, or group and aggregate data records. Many such stateful operators are provided by the <a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/#streams_dsl><strong>Kafka Streams DSL</strong></a>.</p><p>Kafka Streams provides so-called <strong>state stores</strong> , which can be used by stream processing applications to store and query data. This is an important capability when implementing stateful operations. Every task in Kafka Streams embeds one or more state stores that can be accessed via APIs to store and query data required for processing. These state stores can either be a persistent key-value store, an in-memory hashmap, or another convenient data structure. Kafka Streams offers fault-tolerance and automatic recovery for local state stores.</p><p>Kafka Streams allows direct read-only queries of the state stores by methods, threads, processes or applications external to the stream processing application that created the state stores. This is provided through a feature called <strong>Interactive Queries</strong>. All stores are named and Interactive Queries exposes only the read operations of the underlying implementation.</p><h1 id=processing-guarantees>Processing Guarantees<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#processing-guarantees aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>In stream processing, one of the most frequently asked question is &ldquo;does my stream processing system guarantee that each record is processed once and only once, even if some failures are encountered in the middle of processing?&rdquo; Failing to guarantee exactly-once stream processing is a deal-breaker for many applications that cannot tolerate any data-loss or data duplicates, and in that case a batch-oriented framework is usually used in addition to the stream processing pipeline, known as the <a href=http://lambda-architecture.net/>Lambda Architecture</a>. Prior to 0.11.0.0, Kafka only provides at-least-once delivery guarantees and hence any stream processing systems that leverage it as the backend storage could not guarantee end-to-end exactly-once semantics. In fact, even for those stream processing systems that claim to support exactly-once processing, as long as they are reading from / writing to Kafka as the source / sink, their applications cannot actually guarantee that no duplicates will be generated throughout the pipeline. Since the 0.11.0.0 release, Kafka has added support to allow its producers to send messages to different topic partitions in a <a href=/#semantics>transactional and idempotent manner</a>, and Kafka Streams has hence added the end-to-end exactly-once processing semantics by leveraging these features. More specifically, it guarantees that for any record read from the source Kafka topics, its processing results will be reflected exactly once in the output Kafka topic as well as in the state stores for stateful operations. Note the key difference between Kafka Streams end-to-end exactly-once guarantee with other stream processing frameworks&rsquo; claimed guarantees is that Kafka Streams tightly integrates with the underlying Kafka storage system and ensure that commits on the input topic offsets, updates on the state stores, and writes to the output topics will be completed atomically instead of treating Kafka as an external system that may have side-effects. To read more details on how this is done inside Kafka Streams, readers are recommended to read <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-129%3A+Streams+Exactly-Once+Semantics>KIP-129</a>. In order to achieve exactly-once semantics when running Kafka Streams applications, users can simply set the <code>processing.guarantee</code> config value to <strong>exactly_once</strong> (default value is <strong>at_least_once</strong>). More details can be found in the <a href=/0110/documentation#streamsconfigs><strong>Kafka Streams Configs</strong></a> section.</p><p><a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/>Previous</a> <a href=/0110/streams/architecture/>Next</a></p><ul><li><a href=/documentation>Documentation</a></li><li><a href=/streams>Kafka Streams API</a></li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-19d4817706ed722e399543915ec2c6e2>9.5 - Architecture</h1><h1 id=architecture>Architecture<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#architecture aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka Streams simplifies application development by building on the Kafka producer and consumer libraries and leveraging the native capabilities of Kafka to offer data parallelism, distributed coordination, fault tolerance, and operational simplicity. In this section, we describe how Kafka Streams works underneath the covers.</p><p>The picture below shows the anatomy of an application that uses the Kafka Streams library. Let&rsquo;s walk through some details.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-architecture-overview.jpg></p><h1 id=stream-partitions-and-tasks>Stream Partitions and Tasks<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#stream-partitions-and-tasks aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>The messaging layer of Kafka partitions data for storing and transporting it. Kafka Streams partitions data for processing it. In both cases, this partitioning is what enables data locality, elasticity, scalability, high performance, and fault tolerance. Kafka Streams uses the concepts of <strong>partitions</strong> and <strong>tasks</strong> as logical units of its parallelism model based on Kafka topic partitions. There are close links between Kafka Streams and Kafka in the context of parallelism:</p><ul><li>Each <strong>stream partition</strong> is a totally ordered sequence of data records and maps to a Kafka <strong>topic partition</strong>.</li><li>A <strong>data record</strong> in the stream maps to a Kafka <strong>message</strong> from that topic.</li><li>The <strong>keys</strong> of data records determine the partitioning of data in both Kafka and Kafka Streams, i.e., how data is routed to specific partitions within topics.</li></ul><p>An application&rsquo;s processor topology is scaled by breaking it into multiple tasks. More specifically, Kafka Streams creates a fixed number of tasks based on the input stream partitions for the application, with each task assigned a list of partitions from the input streams (i.e., Kafka topics). The assignment of partitions to tasks never changes so that each task is a fixed unit of parallelism of the application. Tasks can then instantiate their own processor topology based on the assigned partitions; they also maintain a buffer for each of its assigned partitions and process messages one-at-a-time from these record buffers. As a result stream tasks can be processed independently and in parallel without manual intervention.</p><p>Slightly simplified, the maximum parallelism at which your application may run is bounded by the maximum number of stream tasks, which itself is determined by maximum number of partitions of the input topic(s) the application is reading from. For example, if your input topic has 5 partitions, then you can run up to 5 applications instances. These instances will collaboratively process the topic’s data. If you run a larger number of app instances than partitions of the input topic, the “excess” app instances will launch but remain idle; however, if one of the busy instances goes down, one of the idle instances will resume the former’s work.</p><p>It is important to understand that Kafka Streams is not a resource manager, but a library that &ldquo;runs&rdquo; anywhere its stream processing application runs. Multiple instances of the application are executed either on the same machine, or spread across multiple machines and tasks can be distributed automatically by the library to those running application instances. The assignment of partitions to tasks never changes; if an application instance fails, all its assigned tasks will be automatically restarted on other instances and continue to consume from the same stream partitions.</p><p>The following diagram shows two tasks each assigned with one partition of the input streams.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-architecture-tasks.jpg></p><h1 id=threading-model>Threading Model<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#threading-model aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka Streams allows the user to configure the number of <strong>threads</strong> that the library can use to parallelize processing within an application instance. Each thread can execute one or more tasks with their processor topologies independently. For example, the following diagram shows one stream thread running two stream tasks.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-architecture-threads.jpg></p><p>Starting more stream threads or more instances of the application merely amounts to replicating the topology and having it process a different subset of Kafka partitions, effectively parallelizing processing. It is worth noting that there is no shared state amongst the threads, so no inter-thread coordination is necessary. This makes it very simple to run topologies in parallel across the application instances and threads. The assignment of Kafka topic partitions amongst the various stream threads is transparently handled by Kafka Streams leveraging <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Client-side+Assignment+Proposal>Kafka&rsquo;s coordination</a> functionality.</p><p>As we described above, scaling your stream processing application with Kafka Streams is easy: you merely need to start additional instances of your application, and Kafka Streams takes care of distributing partitions amongst tasks that run in the application instances. You can start as many threads of the application as there are input Kafka topic partitions so that, across all running instances of an application, every thread (or rather, the tasks it runs) has at least one input partition to process.</p><h1 id=local-state-stores>Local State Stores<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#local-state-stores aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka Streams provides so-called <strong>state stores</strong> , which can be used by stream processing applications to store and query data, which is an important capability when implementing stateful operations. The <a href=/0110/streams/developer-guide/#streams_dsl>Kafka Streams DSL</a>, for example, automatically creates and manages such state stores when you are calling stateful operators such as <code>join()</code> or <code>aggregate()</code>, or when you are windowing a stream.</p><p>Every stream task in a Kafka Streams application may embed one or more local state stores that can be accessed via APIs to store and query data required for processing. Kafka Streams offers fault-tolerance and automatic recovery for such local state stores.</p><p>The following diagram shows two stream tasks with their dedicated local state stores.</p><p><img src=/0110/images/streams-architecture-states.jpg></p><h1 id=fault-tolerance>Fault Tolerance<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#fault-tolerance aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Kafka Streams builds on fault-tolerance capabilities integrated natively within Kafka. Kafka partitions are highly available and replicated; so when stream data is persisted to Kafka it is available even if the application fails and needs to re-process it. Tasks in Kafka Streams leverage the fault-tolerance capability offered by the <a href=https://www.confluent.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-the-new-apache-kafka-0.9-consumer-client/>Kafka consumer client</a> to handle failures. If a task runs on a machine that fails, Kafka Streams automatically restarts the task in one of the remaining running instances of the application.</p><p>In addition, Kafka Streams makes sure that the local state stores are robust to failures, too. For each state store, it maintains a replicated changelog Kafka topic in which it tracks any state updates. These changelog topics are partitioned as well so that each local state store instance, and hence the task accessing the store, has its own dedicated changelog topic partition. <a href=/0110/#compaction>Log compaction</a> is enabled on the changelog topics so that old data can be purged safely to prevent the topics from growing indefinitely. If tasks run on a machine that fails and are restarted on another machine, Kafka Streams guarantees to restore their associated state stores to the content before the failure by replaying the corresponding changelog topics prior to resuming the processing on the newly started tasks. As a result, failure handling is completely transparent to the end user.</p><p>Note that the cost of task (re)initialization typically depends primarily on the time for restoring the state by replaying the state stores&rsquo; associated changelog topics. To minimize this restoration time, users can configure their applications to have <strong>standby replicas</strong> of local states (i.e. fully replicated copies of the state). When a task migration happens, Kafka Streams then attempts to assign a task to an application instance where such a standby replica already exists in order to minimize the task (re)initialization cost. See <code>num.standby.replicas</code> in the <a href=/0110/#streamsconfigs><strong>Kafka Streams Configs</strong></a> section.</p><p><a href=/0110/streams/core-concepts/>Previous</a> <a href=/0110/streams/upgrade-guide/>Next</a></p><ul><li><a href=/documentation>Documentation</a></li><li><a href=/streams>Kafka Streams API</a></li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-01bfd138c96bd0bd13a715b6c13a7a65>9.6 - Upgrade Guide</h1><h1 id=upgrade-guide--api-changes>Upgrade Guide & API Changes<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#upgrade-guide--api-changes aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>If you want to upgrade from 0.10.2.x to 0.11.0 you don&rsquo;t need to do any code changes as the public API is fully backward compatible. However, some configuration parameters were deprecated and thus it is recommend to update your code eventually to allow for future upgrades. See below a complete list of 0.11.0 API and semantical changes that allow you to advance your application and/or simplify your code base, including the usage of new features.</p><p>If you want to upgrade from 0.10.1.x to 0.11.0, also see the <a href=/0110/upgrade/#upgrade_1020_streams><strong>Upgrade Section for 0.10.2</strong></a>.
