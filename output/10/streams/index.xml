The easiest way to write mission-critical real-time applications and microservices Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka&amp;rsquo;s server-side cluster technology.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/quickstart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/quickstart/</guid><description>Run Streams Demo Application Introduction Run Demo App Tutorial: Write App Concepts Architecture Developer Guide Upgrade
This tutorial assumes you are starting fresh and have no existing Kafka or ZooKeeper data. However, if you have already started Kafka and ZooKeeper, feel free to skip the first two steps.
Kafka Streams is a client library for building mission-critical real-time applications and microservices, where the input and/or output data is stored in Kafka clusters.</description></item><item><title>Write a streams app</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/tutorial/</guid><description>Tutorial: Write a Streams Application Introduction Run Demo App Tutorial: Write App Concepts Architecture Developer Guide Upgrade
In this guide we will start from scratch on setting up your own project to write a stream processing application using Kafka Streams. It is highly recommended to read the quickstart first on how to run a Streams application written in Kafka Streams if you have not done so.
Setting up a Maven Project We are going to use a Kafka Streams Maven Archetype for creating a Streams project structure with the following commands:</description></item><item><title>Core Concepts</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/core-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/core-concepts/</guid><description>Core Concepts Introduction Run Demo App Tutorial: Write App Concepts Architecture Developer Guide Upgrade
Kafka Streams is a client library for processing and analyzing data stored in Kafka. It builds upon important stream processing concepts such as properly distinguishing between event time and processing time, windowing support, and simple yet efficient management and real-time querying of application state.
Kafka Streams has a low barrier to entry : You can quickly write and run a small-scale proof-of-concept on a single machine; and you only need to run additional instances of your application on multiple machines to scale up to high-volume production workloads.</description></item><item><title>Architecture</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/architecture/</guid><description>Architecture Introduction Run Demo App Tutorial: Write App Concepts Architecture Developer Guide Upgrade
Kafka Streams simplifies application development by building on the Kafka producer and consumer libraries and leveraging the native capabilities of Kafka to offer data parallelism, distributed coordination, fault tolerance, and operational simplicity. In this section, we describe how Kafka Streams works underneath the covers.
The picture below shows the anatomy of an application that uses the Kafka Streams library.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade Guide</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/upgrade-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/10/streams/upgrade-guide/</guid><description>Upgrade Guide &amp;amp; API Changes Introduction Run Demo App Tutorial: Write App Concepts Architecture Developer Guide Upgrade
If you want to upgrade from 0.10.2.x or 0.11.0.x to 1.0.x you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do any code changes as the public API is fully backward compatible. However, some public APIs were deprecated and thus it is recommended to update your code eventually to allow for future upgrades. See below a complete list of 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
