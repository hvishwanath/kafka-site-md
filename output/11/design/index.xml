To do this we had to think through a fairly broad set of use cases.
It would have to have high-throughput to support high volume event streams such as real-time log aggregation.
It would need to deal gracefully with large data backlogs to be able to support periodic data loads from offline systems.</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/11/design/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/11/design/protocol/</guid><description>Kafka protocol guide This document covers the wire protocol implemented in Kafka. It is meant to give a readable guide to the protocol that covers the available requests, their binary format, and the proper way to make use of them to implement a client. This document assumes you understand the basic design and terminology described here
Preliminaries Network Partitioning and bootstrapping Partitioning Strategies Batching Versioning and Compatibility The Protocol Protocol Primitive Types Notes on reading the request format grammars Common Request and Response Structure Message Sets Constants Error Codes Api Keys The Messages Some Common Philosophical Questions Preliminaries Network Kafka uses a binary protocol over TCP.</description></item></channel></rss>
