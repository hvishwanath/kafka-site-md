What exactly does that mean? We think of a streaming platform as having three key capabilities:
It let&amp;rsquo;s you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system. It let&amp;rsquo;s you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way. It let&amp;rsquo;s you process streams of records as they occur. What is Kafka good for?</description></item><item><title>Use Cases</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/uses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/uses/</guid><description>Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka. For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see this blog post.
Messaging Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc). In comparison to most messaging systems Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good solution for large scale message processing applications.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/quickstart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/quickstart/</guid><description>This tutorial assumes you are starting fresh and have no existing Kafka or ZooKeeper data.
Step 1: Download the code Download the 0.10.0.0 release and un-tar it.
&amp;gt; **tar -xzf kafka_2.11-0.10.0.0.tgz** &amp;gt; **cd kafka_2.11-0.10.0.0** Step 2: Start the server Kafka uses ZooKeeper so you need to first start a ZooKeeper server if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can use the convenience script packaged with kafka to get a quick-and-dirty single-node ZooKeeper instance.</description></item><item><title>Ecosystem</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/ecosystem/</guid><description>There are a plethora of tools that integrate with Kafka outside the main distribution. The ecosystem page lists many of these, including stream processing systems, Hadoop integration, monitoring, and deployment tools.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/0100/getting-started/upgrade/</guid><description>Upgrading from 0.8.x or 0.9.x to 0.10.0.0 0.10.0.0 has potential breaking changes (please review before upgrading) and possible performance impact following the upgrade. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime and no performance impact during and following the upgrade.
Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients.
Notes to clients with version 0.9.0.0: Due to a bug introduced in 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
