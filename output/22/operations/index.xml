All of the tools reviewed in this section are available under the bin/ directory of the Kafka distribution and each tool will print details on all possible commandline options if it is run with no arguments.
Adding and removing topics You have the option of either adding topics manually or having them be created automatically when data is first published to a non-existent topic.</description></item><item><title>Datacenters</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/datacenters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/datacenters/</guid><description>Datacenters Some deployments will need to manage a data pipeline that spans multiple datacenters. Our recommended approach to this is to deploy a local Kafka cluster in each datacenter with application instances in each datacenter interacting only with their local cluster and mirroring between clusters (see the documentation on the mirror maker tool for how to do this).
This deployment pattern allows datacenters to act as independent entities and allows us to manage and tune inter-datacenter replication centrally.</description></item><item><title>Kafka Configuration</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/kafka-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/kafka-configuration/</guid><description>Kafka Configuration Important Client Configurations The most important producer configurations are:
acks compression batch size The most important consumer configuration is the fetch size.
All configurations are documented in the configuration section.
A Production Server Config Here is an example production server configuration:
# ZooKeeper zookeeper.connect=[list of ZooKeeper servers] # Log configuration num.partitions=8 default.replication.factor=3 log.dir=[List of directories. Kafka should have its own dedicated disk(s) or SSD(s).] # Other configurations broker.id=[An integer.</description></item><item><title>Java Version</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/java-version/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/java-version/</guid><description>Java Version From a security perspective, we recommend you use the latest released version of JDK 1.8 as older freely available versions have disclosed security vulnerabilities. LinkedIn is currently running JDK 1.8 u5 (looking to upgrade to a newer version) with the G1 collector. LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s tuning looks like this:

You need sufficient memory to buffer active readers and writers. You can do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of memory needs by assuming you want to be able to buffer for 30 seconds and compute your memory need as write_throughput*30.
The disk throughput is important. We have 8x7200 rpm SATA drives. In general disk throughput is the performance bottleneck, and more disks is better.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring Kafka uses Yammer Metrics for metrics reporting in the server. The Java clients use Kafka Metrics, a built-in metrics registry that minimizes transitive dependencies pulled into client applications. Both expose metrics via JMX and can be configured to report stats using pluggable stats reporters to hook up to your monitoring system.
All Kafka rate metrics have a corresponding cumulative count metric with suffix -total. For example, records-consumed-rate has a corresponding metric named records-consumed-total.</description></item><item><title>ZooKeeper</title><link>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/zookeeper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.kafka-site-md.dev/22/operations/zookeeper/</guid><description>ZooKeeper Stable version The current stable branch is 3.4 and the latest release of that branch is 3.4.9.
Operationalizing ZooKeeper Operationally, we do the following for a healthy ZooKeeper installation:
Redundancy in the physical/hardware/network layout: try not to put them all in the same rack, decent (but don&amp;rsquo;t go nuts) hardware, try to keep redundant power and network paths, etc. A typical ZooKeeper ensemble has 5 or 7 servers, which tolerates 2 and 3 servers down, respectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
